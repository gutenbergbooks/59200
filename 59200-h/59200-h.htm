<h1 class='nobreak' id='t135'>CHAPTER I</h1>

<p class='pindent'>In this day of kaleidoscopic changes, of brand-new
ultra “smartness,” of emancipations so tremendous,
so upheaving, so incalculably far-reaching that to some
they almost seem to forecast the end of all things, still
there are old bulwarks of customs, of character, of individualities
and of life itself that neither change nor are
changed. The Townsends of Virginia are today just
what they were long before 1776.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is only one of them left—Miss Julia—but she
is they—the Townsends of Virginia; gracious, unapproachable,
deft in a small, delicate way with her harpsichord,
accomplished at her jellies, proud of her naperies,
tyrannous and over-indulgent to her darkies, a fine judge
of horseflesh, sure of herself, doubtful of you—unless
your forebears of the same “first-families” caste as hers,
had been born, had wived and begotten and borne, as
hers invariably had, in Virginia—a stanch Episcopalian,
refined to the <span class='it'>n</span>th degree, intolerant, sentimental—but
too proud, and of too good form, to own or to
show it—exclusive, generous—except of her acquaintance
and in her opinions—a writer of feeble verses,
brilliant along her own selected and approved lines, dull
and ill-informed on all others, autocratic and secretly
supersensitive, a <span class='it'>gourmet</span> who ate very little, an expert
judge of good wines who rarely drank them—buttermilk
was her one creature weakness—charitable (although she
was poorly enough off—had to count her dimes, and
couldn’t count with even pretense at accuracy)—charitable
to every “good work” she approved of or hungry
creature that came to her back door, relentlessly uncharitable
to any cause she did not sympathize with and to
any “beggar” who presumed at her front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosehill, the home she lived in, had more and finer
magnolias than it had roses, but a great many and very
beautiful roses grew at Rosehill. And in August you
could smell the musk and the heliotrope right across the
Potomac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exterior of the old red-brick “mansion” was
beautiful only because so many had loved it, because
birth, bridal and death so often had hallowed it, and
because so many beautiful things grew about it, some of
them nailed up on its mellowed red walls, some climbing
there needing no nailing, for their young tendrils loved
every tiny chink that time had furrowed in those old
bricks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosehill was on the river-edge of Virginia, only a
pleasant jaunt from Washington, but it <span class='it'>was</span> Virginia.
In the core of the old virgin state itself the Civil War
had ruined or wrenched from them every holding the
Townsends ever had had. But Rosehill remained to the
Southern general’s widow, and here she had come with
the two children the war had left her, and lived in it
bitterly enough to the hour of her death, but had kept
her Virginian state as far as she could with an altered
purse in an altered country, and modifying in nothing
her Virginian ways or manner of life. And here Julia
Townsend had grown up and lived serenely enough, for
she had been in her cradle when Lee faced Appomattox,
and she remembered no other home. She inherited and
kept all her mother’s prejudices, but little of her
mother’s bitterness. She even pitied all Northerners
more than she disliked them. She never by any chance
broke Northern bread, but now and then she permitted
some distinguished few of them to break her bread—a
little “below the salt,” but graciously. But no denizen
of the White House could win through her gates, and
she’d have eaten crusts in a thieves’ kitchen, or, if it
comes to that, brimstone in a place and company she was
too refined ever to mention, far more willingly and with
far less sense of degradation, than she would have eaten
or drunk at the White House, or soiled the sole of her
shoe on its carpets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her purse, such thin thing as it was, had freely been
at the service of Grover Cleveland’s election war-chest—but
she never had received him. The successor in
Union office of Abraham Lincoln could not visit Julia
Townsend. But, beyond the stigma of “Union” the
chief executive of these United States was sunk even
lower in the proud, unwavering estimate of Julia Calhoun
Townsend: on some days of his administration the
President of the United States received—he had to—<span class='it'>any</span>
citizen who chose and made it convenient to file past
him, had to receive and shake by the hand. President
Cleveland might have no escape from shaking hands with
his own negro coachman! True—Julia Townsend had
lived and thrived for nine months at the breast of a
negro woman, rather darker of skin, as it chanced, than
Mr. Cleveland’s colored coachman—but that was different.
It was <span class='it'>done</span> in Virginia, and though Mrs. Townsend
had cried her heart (and her rage) out on the
same faithful black breast, she never had shaken hands
with her; neither she nor any other Townsend had ever
done such a thing—or could have done. You might (in
her creed of caste) caress a negro, you could not greet
one on such show of social parity as the shaking of hands
implied; you might befriend them—clearly that was
your duty, and no Townsend ever shirked a duty;
you could accept their service to the last strain of
their muscle, the last drop of red in their veins;
even, if you were a man, you might mingle the blood
in your blue veins with their blood—but you did not
drink tea with them, or shake their hands. This last
branch of the subject—perhaps most conveniently called
the mulatto-quadroon-and-such branch, was one upon
which Miss Townsend never spoke and preferred not to
think; but she was quite familiar with it, and accepted
it with a caste-complaisance that completely and permanently
anesthetized, even if it had not killed, as probably
it had, any moral revulsion, or, less than revulsion,
criticism. She accepted it easily and naturally as she
did all else that the “first families” had done since
Raleigh named Virginia after Elizabeth until now, long
after War’s terrible arbitrament had made the proud
virgin state a desolation and a memory. At the thought
that President Cleveland might have had to shake a
negro “citizen” by the hand, her nostril quivered, her
spleen rose, and her old soul stiffened. She pitied Mr.
Cleveland—a man she respected for much—but the dire
possible official necessity had made it forever impossible
that Grover Cleveland’s hand should ever touch the hand
of Julia Calhoun Townsend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During one administration, a Republican administration,
the unspeakable thing actually happened. And the
mistress of Rosehill chuckled. She was glad. The
President’s wife, as determined a creature in her way
as ever her soldier had been in his, and far quicker of
temper, one morning for his impertinence summarily
discharged her colored coachman, and that same afternoon
the dismissed negro turned up in the line of citizens
that filed past the President in the Blue Room, and held
out a hand that the President had to clasp—and did—probably
did with an inward chuckle of his own, for he
himself had sometimes something to endure from his
wife’s metal. <span class='it'>She</span> was furious. The story wild-fired
through Washington, it crossed the Potomac long before
sunset, reached Miss Townsend in her rose-and-magnolia-bound
fastness, and gave her more pleasure than she
often had known. Ulysses Grant may live longer and
stronger in history than Grover Cleveland. But Grant
was a Republican, had fought Lee, and had presumed to
defeat him. Julia Townsend chuckled wickedly, and
drank wine, quite a small glassful of a priceless vintage,
at her solitary supper that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been but a girl still during the Cleveland and
Grant administrations, but a girl with all a woman’s
venom in her hot Southern heart. And she had come
into her heritage—such as the War had left it—in her
motherless girlhood; for the mother had not lived many
years after the defeat of the Confederacy. Hate killed
her. The men of the South forgave. The women could
not—some of them have not even yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Rosehill was but on the edge of Virginia, and a
little discounted by its too-nearness to the disloyal capital
from which only the river saved it and to which Long
Bridge linked it, and lay not far from Arlington, where
the “blue” slept as well as the sainted “gray” and
many civilians stanchly Northerners, it was no alien
or unsuitable residence for a Townsend. Townsends
had owned it for more than a century. A Townsend had
built the house. Only Townsends ever had lived in it.
Miss Julia had inherited it from her mother, for the
mother had been born a Townsend and had married a
second cousin. Julia Townsend had a double right to all
the Townsend traits and possessions. Those possessions,
great once, had dwindled now to Rosehill and a narrow
(even for one) income, but the traits flourished and
were strong, and Julia had her full double share of
them. The dwindled and still dwindling income scarcely
sufficed for the decent upkeeping of the simple old place,
and the quiet old gentlewoman; but they managed—Rosehill,
Miss Julia Townsend and her negroes: Rosehill
flaunted its flowers, the darkies obeyed their imperious,
kindly ole’ missus, and Julia Townsend wore her
poverty as a duchess is supposed to wear her own ermine
and her husband’s strawberry leaves—and usually
doesn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Social Washington courted Miss Townsend—partly
because she was well worth courting, partly because she
rather despised it, not a little because, when she did offer
hospitality, her “parties” were the pleasantest functions
that ever came the capital’s way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You couldn’t “drop in” on Miss Julia—no matter who
you were or why you came. Her kitchen door was always
on the latch. Her front door was guarded stiffly.
Into no function of hers could you penetrate casually.
You were hopelessly debarred unless she had sent you
“a card” of invitation—which was a card only in name.
She invariably wrote the “cards” herself, in her fine
spidery hand, on sheets of cream-smooth, velvet-thick
paper, scorning the modernity of engraved invitations.
If she consented to receive you at all, she paid you the
compliment of telling you so in her own handwriting,
which not only saved the expense of engraving, and
seemed to her more befitting her dignity, but filled considerable
time for her with an occupation she much
enjoyed. Her hair-line handwriting was peculiarly
beautiful, and she delighted both in producing it and in
displaying it. Julia Townsend had many vanities. But
they all were innocent ones, and womanly. And, if
her avoidance of engraved “At Home” cards was one
of her many economies, it was (and her others were
not) an accidental one. And her note-paper was a proud
extravagance. Only the best paper was good enough,
she thought, to record the honor of an invitation accorded
from Rosehill, or to be embellished with such
beautiful writing as hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On “Second Thursdays,” as her visiting cards indicated
in the lower left-hand corner—her visiting cards
were engraved—Miss Townsend was “At Home,” but
it was for no one to venture to call unless Miss Townsend
had “left cards” upon you. She called on no one;
but once a month, unless it was Lent, “Uncle Lysander,”
dressed in his speckless best, crossed the river and, with
much ceremony and many bows, left a card of his mistress’s
upon those in the capital whom she cared to honor
with her acquaintance. And if such favor had not been
shown you, you might be very sure that you could induce
Uncle Lysander neither to announce you to Miss Townsend’s
presence, nor to admit you inside her front door
on a second Thursday, or at any other time. A woman
of very high Washington social rank once had brought
with her to a garden party at Rosehill, without permission
or invitation, an English Countess who was staying
with her. Miss Townsend had received Lady Haverhill
graciously, had chanced to like, and approve, her cordially,
had sent cards to her—by Lysander—and, when
the Englishwoman had moved into quarters of her own
at Willard’s, had invited her to dinner. But Mrs. Wentworth
never again received a card of Miss Julia Townsend’s
or admission to Rosehill. You had to be very
careful indeed with Miss Julia—if you wished to retain
her acquaintance. Even to men she indicated her willingness
to receive them by means of a card and Uncle
Lysander. Women in Washington did not, as a rule,
leave visiting cards for their men friends. Miss Townsend
saw fit to: that was sufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for her servants she lived quite alone in the
old red-brick house. At the close of the war they had
been three—the mother and two daughters. But Mrs.
Townsend had died and Clara, the elder girl, had done
something very much worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara had been twenty when the guns had spit at
Fort Sumter. Julia had been born on the day of the
first Battle of Bull Run. Of their four brothers two—the
twins—had been a little older than Clara, the
other two, one a year, one two years younger. Naturally
all four had fought for the Southern Cause. Three
had fallen, as their father had, in battle; Rupert, the
youngest, had died in a Northern prison. If Ruth Townsend
had been without reasonableness in her hatred
of the North, she had not been without cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was Clara Townsend—who lived even now,
though whether she did or not her sister did not know
and did not perhaps care—who had killed their mother.
The death of a man, in battle, with his face to the foe
and his breast set square to the guns, rarely kills a
woman who loves him. Clara had married a man who
had worn not a gray but a blue uniform in the terrible
fratricidal war—a runaway marriage, of course. None
other had been possible. The mother never had mentioned
her name again; even the darkies who had adored
her never whispered her name among themselves—not
even the “mammy” who had suckled her—they were
far too ashamed of her. And Julia, a baby still at the
close of the war, soon after which it had happened, had
no memory of her sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost from her birth Miss Julia had lived a solitary
life. She kept her life aired, even somewhat sunned,
but she shared it, or her self, with none. Every one in
Washington knew her, or tried to; and she knew every
one whom she considered worth knowing, or deserving
it—rather different things sometimes—but she had no
intimates. She lived apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three persons who came nearest to intimacy with
Miss Julia Townsend, so near it indeed that she had accorded
them all permission to “come and see me whenever
you like,” were about the last people in Washington
society—needless to say they were in it—whom one might
have expected her to accept, let alone welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They, as it happened, as yet were unacquainted, each
with the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia’s most nearly intimate friends, and the
three she best liked, were: a woman physician who,
though of high Southern birth, had, like the not-to-be-named
sister Clara, disgraced herself by becoming the
wife of a Northern man; an English girl of no social
position, beyond that of a nursery governess who chanced
to be a relative of her titled employers; and a young
man, in a minor and rather hazy position at one of the
legations—a Chinese.</p>

<h1 id='t450'>CHAPTER II</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Townsend was “At Home”—and so were
the roses, the strawberries, all the delicate eggshell
china and the old heavy silver. She was giving her annual
garden-party. And that she might entertain her
guests delicately and amply—as a Southern woman
should—it had been shortened commons at Rosehill for
many a week. Not the servants—they had fared as they
always did, and so had the beggars who had gone to the
kitchen door—but the mistress of Rosehill had discontinued
the late-dinner meal—which she called “supper,”
and which she liked—and had gone to bed each night at
dusk, and had refrained from lighting a candle when
sleep would not come. That had been a veritable sacrifice
on the function-altar of hospitality. Next to drinking
buttermilk the thing that Miss Julia most enjoyed
was reading novels in bed—by the soft, clear light of
four or five wax candles. And she, complete hostess
that, true to her blood, she was, had imposed on herself
other personal curtailments and economies that cost
her less but saved her purse more. She had not gone
to a concert or seen a play during her “retreat” of
economy. But, as it chanced, there had been no play
that she much wished to see at a Washington theater
just then. She was an inveterate theater-goer and she
rarely denied herself a matinée that called her. She always
went alone, but she always sat in the best seats, and
Uncle Lysander, his dear black face shining with importance
and his great splay hands encased in snow-white
gloves, always waited outside to escort his mistress home,
whether the matinée ended in the dusk and dark of
winter or in the clear light of summer—if so side-by-side
a word as “escort” can be used of his attendance close
behind Miss Julia. And a “good” concert she missed
very rarely indeed. Miss Julia did not care for classical
music, but she liked to think that she did, and she and
her best bonnet, and her rose-point-lace collar, fastened
carefully (not to injure the priceless mesh) by a gold
and cameo breast-pin that had belonged to Martha Washington,
were as sure to enrich the parquet seats as
Brahms or Grieg or Haydn or Liszt were to appear in
the program. In winter she wore gray or dun-colored
velvet (first made in Paris for a Mrs. Townsend before
Robert Edward Lee was born); in summer thin-textured
silver or lilac silk. In winter she wore a costly Cashmere
shawl, in summer one of heavily embroidered white
Canton silk. The Cashmere shawl had a skimp, narrow,
parti-colored fringe; the Chinese one had a sumptuous,
knotted fringe of its own time-deepened ivory silk. But
she always wore the gold and cameo breast-pin and the
deep collar of rose-point; she always wore gloves of delicate
kid, made by a famous French manufacturer, and
exactly matching her gowns; in winter her black velvet
bonnet (always the same bonnet) nodded an ostrich
feather that matched her gown of the occasion as perfectly
as did her gloves; in summer, her bonnet of white
chip paid the hue of her dress the same ostrich feather
compliment. And winter or summer, she wore uncompromisingly
thick, stout leather boots—but they were well
cut and with heels as high as a fashionable girl’s. She
always took her program home with her. She had volumes
and volumes bound in limp morocco. She often
spoke of them—and sometimes she sent Lysander to purchase
a piano score of some “morceau” that had charmed
her, or that she thought had. But, to her credit, she
never attempted their execution on her own yellow-keyed
harpsichord. She “liked to have them, to think them
over.” Her own greatly favorite musical compositions
were “The Maiden’s Prayer” and “Her Bright Smile
Haunts Me Still.” She played them both tenderly—if
not too brilliantly. And “Dixie” was her anthem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day was perfect. The Potomac ran a “changeable-silk”
glitter of blue and gold. The sky, as blue
as the river, was soft and fluffed with billows of snowy
clouds. The grass was almost as smooth and green as
a well-kept English lawn, and the old red house was
a-nod with roses, its very bricks fragrant from the magnolias
nailed there. Great beds of mignonette cut great
swathes of gray through the green of the grass, and lay
like soft, thick rugs at the edge of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia, wearing a befrilled cream organdie delicately
printed with pink wild-roses and forget-me-nots
more turquoise-tinted than growing forget-me-nots ever
are, stood under the giant juniper tree receiving her bidden
guests. The frills of her full gown were narrowly
edged with lace, and she wore Madame Washington’s
brooch, pinning her befrilled organdie fichu; but the collar
and heirloom of super rose-point was laid away in
its tissue and lavender. To-day she wore brightly beaded
bronze slippers, very high-heeled, pointed-toed. At home
she never wore boots; beyond her gates she never wore
anything else. A pair of shoes she did not own, and
never had. She wore many valuable rings and black
lace mitts on her fine white hands, and held in her right
hand a valuable lace handkerchief, which nothing would
have induced her to use for the purpose for which handkerchiefs
are supposed to be made and bought. It had
been “in the family” for six generations, and it had
never been <span class='it'>used</span>. In her other hand she carried a
tortoise-shell lorgnette which she never used either,
for she had no need to—her sight still was perfectly good—and
Julia Townsend was about the last woman in the
world to affect an infirmity that did not afflict her. She
had considerable manner, but no affectations. Her
manner, always elegant, sometimes more than a little
starched, was not a pose. Her manner was she, and belonged
to her as legitimately as did the many good clothes
she had inherited, as she had it, with birthright from
several generations of Virginia ancestors. She also carried
in her left hand an exceptionally fine, long-stemmed,
very fragrant rose, which she sniffed frequently. If
she shook hands with a guest, the lace handkerchief went
for the moment to keep company with the handsome lorgnette
and the big red rose. She did not shake hands
with every guest that she welcomed, but to all her welcome
was gracious, and she did shake hands with each
guest that bade her adieu, and contrived to convey with
the lingering touch of her old, maidenly fingers how
much she regretted the departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one she had privileged to do so had come.
Almost always it was so. Few ever missed an opportunity
to visit Miss Julia at Rosehill. There was a perfume
and repose both about the woman and her home
that were strongly inviting, and that every one
found strangely refreshing, and that some also found
surprisingly stimulating. And her invitations were too
scrupulously limited to be lightly disregarded. Miss
Julia was old-fashioned, and every one knew she was
poor. (Indeed, she boasted of it indirectly—too highly-bred
to boast openly of anything—frankly proud of her
poverty, since it was part and piece of General Lee’s
defeat.) To be reported in the <span class='it'>Star</span> as having been
among Miss Julia Townsend’s guests gave a social cachet
which nothing in the capital itself could give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one who could be was at Rosehill today. And
in several ways the gathering was more catholic than a
superficial intelligence might have expected. It was
natural enough that a poor public school teacher should
rub shoulders here with a California millionaire, and
the well-known actress seemed a not inappropriate guest,
since her personal character was as unsmirched as her
complexion was natural, and the South always has honored
all the great arts. But a Jewish banker and his
beautiful daughter, a Punjabi prince and the Siamese
Minister might have seemed to some a little unaccountable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Townsend was a stanch Episcopalian, but she
had no theological narrowness. She respected Jews—if
they were orthodox; she’d little tolerance for any apostasy—“character”
was the human quality she most
valued, and her love of beauty—especially the beauty of
women—was almost inordinate. That accounted for Moses
Strauss and his lovely daughter, Esther. The Siamese
Minister and the Punjabi prince were not beautiful, and
neither had been in Washington long enough yet to have
established, or, on the other hand, to have lost, any
great reputation for personal or intellectual character.
It was the fashion just then to “know” all the Orientals
one could—but that was no sesame to the door of Rosehill.
Miss Julia drew a very wide distinction between
Africa and Asia, and she liked to show that she did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four girls sat chatting idly a little way from the small
linen-and-lace-covered table they had impoverished of its
cakes and ice-creams and bonbons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Molly Wheeler—her father was an Oregon Senator—Lucille
Smith—hers was on the supreme bench—and
Mary Withrow, the daughter of the minister of Washington’s
most exclusive church—of course, an Episcopalian
church—were all dressed expensively in glistening white,
as was almost every woman here on this very hot day,
and each wore a pretty and costly hat. The fourth girl
was hatless and her simpler gown was a soft but vivid
green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if you’d grown here, Ivy,” Mary Withrow
exclaimed not unreasonably. For the English girl’s
gown was just the color of the young live-oak leaves that
so interlaced above them where they sat, great lush ferns
growing thickly against the trees’ silver trunks, that a
sort of brilliant green twilight seemed all about them,
although it was scarcely a quarter past four yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I had,” the girl in green replied. “At least,
I wish I lived here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you like Washington?” Lucille demanded
sharply. The jurist’s daughter was stanchly <span class='it'>and
sharply</span> loyal to Washington—grateful to it, too, perhaps,
for the Smiths had come to it <span class='it'>via</span> several less pleasant
localities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate teaching kiddies,” Ivy said with an impatient
shrug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your own cousins are such dear little things,”
Mary remonstrated gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose they are,” Ivy Gilbert conceded, “dear
little things, and they certainly are my cousins—but a
long way off. It isn’t the children I object to—it’s
having to teach them. I like Blanche fairly well, and
I’m fond of Dick—sometimes—and I daresay I’d be
quite fond of them, if I didn’t see them often, and never
<span class='it'>had</span> to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t like teaching?” Mary said, incredulously.
“Oh, I’d love to, more than anything else, if only I knew
enough! And you don’t like to teach? Truly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I loathe it. You don’t know whether you’d like it
or not—until you’ve tried it. You’d know then. But
you don’t have to ‘know enough’ or to know much of
anything. Education’s a very minor asset—at least for
a nursery governess, and I suspect for any other sort of
teacher. There’s only one thing you need: patience,
patience, patience—and then patience! Eternal patience!
Cow-like, door-mat patience. Oh, I loathe the whole
show! Emma’s kind enough. Charley’s a dear. But I
loathe it all. I feel stuck in a ditch! And I want to
move and to <span class='it'>be</span>. I want to <span class='it'>taste</span> life, and make some of it.
But there, let’s talk about something else!” The young,
passionate voice broke off impatiently, and the girl
clutched a great fern from its root and began fanning
herself with it slowly. And the scarlet peppers she wore
dangling at her breast, a splendid splash of Oriental
color on the exquisite jade of her linen gown, shook
passionately as she moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other girls wore flowers—tea-roses and violets—as
girls should. But Ivy had robbed Miss Julia’s kitchen-garden
of a handful of red, red peppers, and fastened
them in her gown. And odd as the garniture was, no one
had commented on it. Ivy Gilbert always was doing
something “queer,” and no one had exclaimed at her
wearing of “vegetables.” And certainly the scarlet
peppers suited her. Her passionate, brunette face, with
its soft, mutinous, gold-brown eyes, its vivid, curved lips,
its crown of dark, curling hair, and its accentuation of
darker eyebrows and up-curling long lashes, looked more
Spanish than English, as she sat there in the bright
green “twilight,” in her jade-green gown, and the brilliant
red peppers jolting each other at her breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucille hastened to change the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you come to Mrs. Trull’s breakfast?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy shrugged again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t like Maggie Trull, do you?” Molly asked.
“I do, so much; why ever don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She kisses me!” Ivy said angrily, just as two men
came through the gleaming trees. “I hate to be kissed!
It’s a loathsome, indecent thing. I never can forgive
any one who kisses me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men had heard. The white-haired elder smiled a
little under his white mustache. But his younger companion
gravely regarded the girl who had spoken, and
approval lit in his black, inscrutable eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He, the younger man, too, looked a little Spanish, but
less so than Ivy Gilbert did. He was not tall, but fully
of medium height: a very handsome man, dark, beautifully
built, scrupulously dressed, wearing his good
garments indifferently, the flower in his coat as red as
the girl’s scarlet peppers, his glance direct, noncommittal,
a repose about him which only many centuries of culture
can give. His passive face was clear-cut and strong and
scarcely more brunette than Ivy’s own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not the girl herself that arrested him first. It
was what she said—for it struck a century-old note in
his being, and it answered with a throb. He was twenty-seven,
a citizen of the world. But he, too, thought kissing
an impertinence and a nastiness—and he never had
offered it, or suffered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidently a foreigner—he might have passed to many
for an Italian, a Rumanian, a Greek, a Spaniard, or a
Russian—of birth. The birth was indubitable, whatever
the birthplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But one who had traveled far, and watched, would
have recognized him as what he was, Chinese.</p>

<h1 id='t749'>CHAPTER III</h1>

<p class='pindent'>The men lifted their hats, and passed on. General
Cordez knew Lucille and had met the Senator’s
daughter, but he felt no necessity to join the group of
girls on the grass, and no impulse. And the younger
man, knowing none of them except for a very slight
“bowing acquaintance” with Miss Smith, showed no
impulse—if he felt any.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was Sên King-lo,” Lucille said, almost excitedly,
when the men were out of earshot. “I wish
General Cordez had stopped and introduced him to you.
He’s all the rage. I did just meet him once. But he
never gives me a chance to push it a mite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is he—what’s his nationality?” Ivy asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chinese.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy’s lip curled. “What queer cards Miss Julia
knows,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, doesn’t she? And the last woman in the world
you’d think would,” Mary Withrow agreed. “Papa
wouldn’t like me to know some of the people Miss Townsend
does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their talk debouched then to fashions and clothes. Ivy
followed it with listless inattention. The others tossed
and tore it eagerly and hotly. None of them, not even
Lucille, who “had heaps of her things from Paris—and
paid heaps for them, if you want to know”—cared quite
as much for pretty and becoming hats and gowns as the
English girl did. But she had so little money to spend
on what she wore that talk of it always rather stuck
in her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The well-born and the well-clothed, the traveled and
the noted, strolled about the festival grounds, admiring
the flowers, sat in groups at the exquisitely laid little
tables that dotted and white-starred the shady nooks, an
attendant white-clad darky, important and cordial at
each, keeping the flies off with long white-handled brushes
of peacocks’ feathers, and replenishing the dishes and
baskets of ice-cream, charlotte russe and fruit, the cups
of tea and coffee, the jugs of butter-thick cream, and the
cold-beaded glasses of cup—delicate cup of claret or
moselle or cider for the “ladies,” mint juleps in strong
perfection and very tall glasses for the men guests. No
one could better Uncle Lysander at mixing juleps—he
wore white cotton gloves when he pulled the mint from
the kitchen brook-side—and few could equal Julia Townsend,
of the Townsends of Virginia, at the concocting of
cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards sunset, all the burnished hour’s splendor of
colors glowing and melting over the blue and silver
Potomac, a tinkle of banjos came from behind the
tomatoes and asparagus beds. Miss Julia never permitted
her blacks to obtrude jarringly their gift of ripple
and rhythm, but always banjos in the distance played
her garden party guests out of her gates. And as
“Dearest May” signaled softly Miss Julia moved slowly
gatewards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The diva’s eyes filled with tears. “<span class='it'>They</span> are the
sweetest singers,” she said softly, and went quickly.
Miss Julia flushed delicately. She ruled her negroes
with no lax hand—but she loved them. She knew their
faults, blackberry thick! She knew their virtues, their
worth and loyalty. And she never heard their music,
the blackbird music that flutes up from their ebon
throats, the music that tripped from between their broad
finger tips and their banjo-strings, without an affectionate
throbbing in her own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sunset was fainting on the river’s breast. The
banjos thrummed more softly, the sugared, golden voices
sank almost in a whisper. Servants were hanging here
and there a lantern on a low-branched tree—long, iron-ringed,
glass, plantation lanterns. That, too, was a signal—not
a signal to go; a signal to stay. It meant that there
would be supper presently for a favored few—youngsters
probably. Julia Townsend loved to gather “boys and
girls” about her for a more intimate hour when her
statelier hospitalitied had been banjo-dismissed, and
already she had told one here, one there, “I hope you can
stay until ten.” And they knew there’d be fried chicken
and quivering icy jellies, and <span class='it'>perhaps</span> a little dancing on
the lawn—and a punctilious, if pompous, darky servant
to see you home, if you were a girl whose chaperon had
been delicately and tunefully sent home.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Julia Townsend stood at attention—and so did the
remaining guests gathered near her. Ulysses S. Grant
and Philip Sheridan must have done that in the presence
of Julia Townsend listening to “Dixie”—and the soldier
who rode a breathless twenty miles from Winchester to
Cedar Creek would have done it with the sunny sweetness
of a prince—like the prince he was. The South had
its Barbara Frietchies—the North had its Stonewall
Jacksons.</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“I want to be in Dixie——”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The brown English eyes and the black Chinese eyes
met again. Something nearly a smile touched the girl’s
lips. And she noticed that the Chinese—Senn, she
thought Lucille had said his name was—held his hat in
his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was <span class='it'>he</span> staying to supper then—a Chinese? Surely
not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as it proved, he was. He not only stayed, but he
sat on Miss Gilbert’s left hand. She was not over-pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course it was for Miss Julia to select her own guests.
That was understood and accepted. But the nursery
governess did a little resent the supper seating arrangements.
Miss Julia herself made them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Gilbert was too thoroughly English to draw the
social color-line as white Americans drew it. She had
seen Hindoos and Japanese on a perfect—or so it seemed—parity
with the other undergraduates at Oxford and
Cambridge. A duchess, who was an acquaintance of
Lady Snow’s, had, to Ivy’s knowledge, made straining
and costly efforts to secure as her guest a Persian prince
not many seasons ago, and on doing it had been both
congratulated and envied. She had seen her own Royal
Family in cordial conversation with a turbaned Maharajah,
even the royal lady who was reputed most exclusive
and proud. And, though her own small experience of
social functions at home had been rather of Balham and
West Kensington than of Mayfair, she would have been
not only interested but flattered to know well any Indian—of
sufficient rank and European or Europeanized education
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but a Chinese—well, really!</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the fault was far more Miss Julia’s than his—he
couldn’t help being Chinese, of course—and since
he was here, Miss Julia’s invited guest, it was for her,
another guest, not to be impolite. So, perhaps feeling
that a more brilliant remark would be a <span class='it'>faux pas</span>, too
unfair a strain on Chinese <span class='it'>savoir faire</span>, she turned
towards Sên King-lo slightly and asked him pleasantly,
“How do you like America?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A smile flickered across the man’s mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much as the curate liked his egg, Miss Gilbert,”
he told her gravely, then added with a franker smile,
“which is how I like most countries, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! You are homesick!” But having said it, the
girl blushed angrily—angry with herself for having said
what she felt, as soon as she’d said it, to have been far
from in good taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Terribly,” Sên said gravely—“sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry I said that,” she said quickly. “I ought
not,” she added with a little guilty sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” he disputed her courteously, “I am glad to
answer any question you are good enough to ask. And,
if there is <span class='it'>one</span> thing of which no man should be ashamed,
it is being homesick, surely. And you made me no risk
of criticizing your country—since you are not American—but
English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? We never have spoken to each other until now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you told me yourself, Miss Gilbert. I heard you
speak as General Cordez and I were walking together.
I heard you say several words. If I had heard you
speak but one, I’d have known that you were English.
An English voice in English speech is one of the few
things that cannot be mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl flushed again—delicately this time, and with
pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We Chinese,” he continued, “have a proverb, ‘If one
word misses the mark, a thousand will do the same.’
And, if one English word spoken by an educated English
voice does not proclaim nationality as nothing else can,
it is because it falls on very dull or quite deaf ears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you many proverbs in your language?” she
asked, fishing about a little desperately for her next thing
to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Millions,” he said decidedly. “And we all know
them all, and all say them at once. Probably at this
moment, in China, four hundred millions of people are
saying, ‘He that grasps, loses,’ or ‘The knowing ones are
not hard, the hard ones are not knowing,’ or ‘The serpent
knows his own hole,’ or ‘Those who know how to do a
thing do not find it difficult; those who find it difficult
know not how to do it,’ or ‘Even the tiger has his naps.’
No, though, I am wrong. It is both night-time and
day-time in China now—my country sprawls so wide
from East to West—but I have no doubt that at home,
easily a hundred million Chinese are quoting time-honored
adages and proverbs at this moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How perfectly terrible!” she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo laughed back with her. There was no
familiarity in his laughter, but a good deal of deferential
good-fellowship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never heard Chinese spoken,” Miss Gilbert
told him. “It is a terribly difficult language to learn—for
a foreigner, I mean, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Sên said stoutly. “That is always said—has
been said ever since Marco Polo’s time. But it is not
true. Chinese is very easy to learn really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never heard it,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you care to? Shall I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please.” She scarce could make any other answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said something in a low, clear voice. It ought to
have reached her alone under the hum of the general
table talk. But at Miss Julia’s board no one spoke shrilly,
and, whatever happened in China, in the dining-room of
Rosehill all did <span class='it'>not</span> speak at once. And the inevitable
rise and fall of intonation—which is nine-tenths of the
Chinese vocabulary—rang it through to others. Two or
three people stopped talking, and half a dozen pricked
up questioning ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia challenged her guest frankly. “What are
you saying?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo bowed his head towards his hostess, and
answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something that Confucius said a long time ago,
Madame. This: ‘Our greatest glory is, not in never
falling, but in rising every time we fall.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True and admirable!” Miss Julia said proudly. Her
old eyes flashed. She was thinking of Appomattox—of a
cause that she never would yield as permanently lost.
And Sên King-lo, a far-off look in his dark, masked eyes,
was thinking of Shantung. The East and the West do
meet sometimes in the selfsameness of human emotions.</p>

<h1 id='t1081'>CHAPTER IV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>The supper was long. It might have been called a
little heavy, if the food had not been so very good.
It is not of the South to offer a guest a simple meal.
Miss Julia gave her guests more than fried chicken and
quivering ice-cold jellies. She gave them scalloped
oysters, she gave them corn-oysters (an entirely vegetable
but very “filling” dish). She gave them gumbo, and
pickles made out of water-melon rinds. She gave them
several salads. The oysters were not the sole shellfish,
and the sweets—Miss Julia called them all “the dessert,”
and Uncle Lysander called them all “puddin’ ”—covered
the shining tops of two great priceless sideboards, and
their overflow covered one of the long, narrow side-tables.
They sat a long time at supper. The oysters had
given place to lemon sherbet as Sên King-lo had quoted
Confucius, and after the sherbet he turned and talked
for a time to his left-hand neighbor, and the English
girl chatted to the New Orleans man on her right. But
after a course and another, they spoke together again—the
merest social decency, since their hostess had put the
girl on his right hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>sounded</span> hard—very nearly impossible to learn,”
Ivy said, taking up their chat just where Miss Julia
had torn it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you try?” Sên asked lightly. “I’d like to
teach you—Chinese.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you would,” the girl retorted. “I’d
not like to teach any one anything. I teach for my
living.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You!” the Chinese exclaimed—frank and honest
admiration in tone and glance. “How young you are to
know enough to follow that great career. The greatest
of all careers, we think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know anything at all,” Ivy assured him. “I
only teach C-A-T—cat; B-A-T—bat; and wash their
faces—my cousins Dick and Blanche—when they’ll hold
their faces still long enough. And when they don’t
their mother scolds me. I hate it all—and so do they.
But I have to—to earn my living.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo looked more approval than sympathy.
Poverty is no social bar-sinister in China, scarcely a
handicap in what, until the Manchus fell, was the
soundest and truest democracy in human history—not a
rabble democracy, but a democracy of dignity, justice,
fair play and spiritual equal chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I should like teaching you Chinese,” he insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why ever, why?” the girl demanded discouragingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To pay a debt,” he replied with a smile. “We
Chinese must be free of debt on our New Year, and that
would just about give me time. And you—I know what
you think—you think you’d find my language dull, and
that you never would have any use for it. But you may
go to China one day, and then you’d find it very useful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I go to China? No such luck! Jersey City perhaps,
or even Margate, after we get home again. But I shall
never see your country, Mr. Sên—or Calcutta, or Damascus,
or Venice, or Madrid. I shall travel in narrow gray
ways always. It is written.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên shook his head. “We never can tell,” he reminded
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can,” she said briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed at her again. Then—“Well, but, let me
get out of debt then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the debt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I tell you? I wonder. You, I fear, Miss Gilbert,
will not like it. It will not seem to you a compliment.
But it <span class='it'>is</span> one—from me. I’d like to tell you. Shall I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl nodded—a little indifferently, a little coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought,” Sên answered gravely, “when I saw you
there in the live-oak trees this afternoon, that you looked
something like a Chinese girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Gilbert stiffened, her eyes grew icy. Sên King-lo
had been right. She did not like it at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sên King-lo went steadily on. “Forgive me, if
you dislike it, resent it so much. To me—it was a sip
of cold water in a parching land, on a parching day.
Perhaps I was wrong. Probably I was—for I never have
seen a Chinese girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gilbert’s resentment receded before her surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never—have seen—a Chinese girl!” she said
blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a lady,” he told her. “One sees coolie girls, of
course—everywhere. But I have been from home a great
many years now. When I was a boy Chinese ladies
were not seen outside their own homes—as so many of
them are now, I understand. And I had no sisters. My
mother was only a girl when she left us, but I do not
remember my mother. I was very young, a baby, when
she went. I know a Chinese lady here and there: here
in Washington, two; several in Europe—but they all
are married ladies—and, too, they often seem to me a
little un-Chinese, because they wear English clothes and
eat with a fork—as, for the very same reasons, I, no
doubt, seem not quite Chinese to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gilbert glanced down involuntarily at his hand—he
was lifting food with his fork, quite accustomedly—and
she looked up again, a question she would not have
asked for worlds in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” Sên told her, “I can use chop-sticks.
I can eat ice-cream even with chop-sticks—if it is not
very feeble—melted. But I like your forks much better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl colored slightly in her surprise. She had
yet to learn that many Chinese can read thoughts almost
as easily as they can read printed words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never have known a Chinese woman at all well.
Miss Townsend is my closest woman friend. Odd that,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I never have seen a Chinese girl of our own
caste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did he mean his own caste, or his and hers? Again
the man had startled her. It was a rather weird thought
that in his opinion (in her opinion it was an impossibility)
she and any Chinese might have caste in common—caste
or any other social bond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you were English before I saw you, because
I had heard your voice first. But when I looked to where
the voice had sounded, it seemed to me—just for a
moment—that China was not the long way off that it has
been for years. You were wearing some material the
color of much of our rarest jade. Almost all the ladies
here were wearing white. It often looks to Chinese eyes
as if every woman in the West went into mourning as
soon as summer comes. That always jars a little. We
love summer—the sun, the flowers, the heat, all that it
stands for, and promises. Even our terrible Yellow
Sorrow laughs and is happy when summer comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Gilbert had no idea what he meant. She never
had heard of the Yangtse-kiang. She scarcely knew
whether China had a river. But Sên King-lo, though he
had had considerable gage of how dense the West’s ken
of the East was, did not suspect her ignorance. Perhaps—because
of the jade-green dress, Sên King-lo was
forgetting himself a little. Even a Chinese man does
that—under certain provocation—at twenty-seven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“White is our ‘black’ you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, she had heard that—though it isn’t quite true;
for the hemp garments of Chinese bereavement are
nearer a dun drab than they are to the white that snow
and lilies wear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your gown struck a note of Chinese color, those
scarlet peppers”—she was wearing them still—“struck
another: their vividness and their dangling. Every
Chinese woman wears something that dangles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?” she interrupted him. “How
do you know what Chinese <span class='it'>girls</span> wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo laughed—his eyes even more than his
mouth. Chinese gentlepeople have the most beautiful
teeth in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” he protested. “That was well-bowled.
But you have not caught me out, leg before wicket. I
have seen pictures of Chinese girls, Miss Gilbert. And
I can read Chinese. Stickpins and girdle ornaments
dangle in half the pages of Chinese romances. You <span class='it'>did</span>
remind me of my home—for the moment. Even the
fern you were fanning yourself with added to the
impression. You fanned yourself a little as we do—with
a Chinese turn of your wrist. I am in your debt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl made no reply beyond a chill, perfunctory
smile. She was slightly amused, still more slightly
interested, and not a little offended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned and, finding a chance, spoke with the man
on her other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that the table talk became more general—as Miss
Julia best liked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much of it was talk well over Ivy Gilbert’s head. She
had heard of the League of Nations and she knew—superficially—what
Bolshevism was, but she never had
heard of Lombroso, or of the cave-temples of Ajanta.
She did not know who Akbar and Barbur were. She did
not know who “John Doe” was. Nor what Pragmatism
meant. She never had heard of Knut Hamsun. She
listened, not greatly interested, and she contributed
nothing. And she was vexed that the only two men of
any special note or maturity there directed a great deal
of their conversation to Mr. Sên King-lo, and that the
part he bore in all that was said seemed not only the
least mean and quite the ablest, most interesting, but
also the quickest and easiest. Certainly his use of
English was the supplest there. A <span class='it'>Chinese</span> turn of her
wrist indeed! She wondered if the odd, tan-colored
creature was able to <span class='it'>think</span> in English? He spoke the
language—hers and Shakespeare’s—almost as if he must
think in it. And he must have been speaking it for a
good many years—his r’s were not l’s. There was more
a something Eastern in the timbre of his voice than
anything distinctly a foreigner’s in his accent. He spoke
her own tongue more as she did, more as she’d usually
heard it at home—though perhaps not invariably in
Balham—as she always heard it in Washington, or
heard it at Harvard or under the elms of New Haven,
when she’d been there last summer for a few vivid international
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no dancing after supper. There was chit-chat
and music—out on the porch. They sang “Annie
Laurie” and “Oft in the Stilly Night” and a fairly
long program dictated by Miss Julia. Then she commanded
Mr. Sên to play—and to sing that little song
she’d liked so much the other night. But he had not
brought an instrument—neither a lute nor his guitar.
Ivy Gilbert’s lip curled a little. So, he was a troubadour,
too! He ought to have worn his lute, or a gilded, inlaid
harp, to the garden party, slung over his shoulder on a
ribbon. She wondered if he could use his fists! Those
delicate, graceful hands did not look as if they’d be
much good at fisticuffs!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not to come without it again,” Miss Julia
told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I call on Sunday mornings, or meet you at
the Wardman Park Inn for lunch, Madame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what and when I mean,” Miss Julia told
him severely. “Go and get a banjo—or something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo rose instantly. “ ‘In all my best I shall
obey you, Madame,’ ” he said with a low and humble
bow, and went off towards the “quarters” beyond the
kitchen-garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did Miss Townsend lunch with a Chinese at the Wardman?
Ivy wondered. Did many women do so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>How—how extraordinary! But it was rather sporting
of Miss Julia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên came back presently from beyond the tomatoes and
the cucumbers, walking briskly, tuning a banjo as he
came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down on the veranda steps, at Miss Julia’s
feet, and began thrumming an old camp-meeting song.
Ivy Gilbert thought the words preposterous, but the lilt
was very pretty—and Miss Julia beat time softly on the
porch railing with her tortoise-shell lorgnette—and Miss
Julia joined in the chorus. Every one did—except Ivy
Gilbert. He sang “My Old Dutch”—Ivy knew that;
and he sang a darky love-song. How could <span class='it'>he</span> do that?
Then he started Harry Lauder’s London latest. And
the English girl, who never had heard of China’s Yellow
Sorrow or of Omi or of Marco Polo, had heard of Harry
Lauder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia hinted deftly at “goodnight” with, “And
now the best for the last. One of your own!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo made the borrowed banjo wail like a soft
wind that grieved and trembled in the moonlight—and
then drifted words into the accompaniment that the girl
fancied he was improvising.</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“There is some one of whom I keep a-thinking;</p>
<p class='line0'>There is some one whom I visit in my dreams,</p>
<p class='line0'>Though a hundred hills stand sentinel between us,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the dark rage of a hundred sunless streams.</p>
<p class='line0'>For the same bright moon is kind to us.</p>
<p class='line0'>And the same untrammeled wind to us.</p>
<p class='line0'>Daring a hundred hills,</p>
<p class='line0'>Whispers the word that thrills.</p>
<p class='line0'>And the dust of my heart, laid bare,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shows the lilies that linger there,”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>he sang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the good-bys were said. And Miss Julia
and Ivy Gilbert were left alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo lingered over Miss Townsend’s hand. Ivy
feared he was going to offer to touch hers. But he did
not, he merely bowed, and without speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was grateful for that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood a moment at her window, looking at the
roses in the moonlight, before she drew her curtain and
began to undress. And, as she stood looking out across
the garden, she drew the scarlet peppers from her bodice
and threw them, testily, out into the night.</p>

<h1 id='t1411'>CHAPTER V</h1>

<p class='pindent'>As they sat at breakfast—Miss Julia and the girl—Lysander
brought his mistress, and proffered on
a great silver salver, a florist’s ribbon-bound box. There
were carnations in it, great dusky, imperial, wine-deep
carnations, ruby red ones, flaming scarlet, blush pink and
lemon, and a handful just the color of tomatoes. Julia
Townsend gathered them up in her hands with a murmur
of delight—as many of them as her hands could hold,
and hung her pleased face over their sumptuous
fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never give a friend’s gift away—or any part of it,”
she said, “or you should have half of these. They belong
to youth,” she added a little sadly—but quite bravely.
“But you shall smell them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl could not help smelling them. They scented
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia took the visiting-card from the box as if she
knew whose it would prove, read it with a smile, and
passed it—as if proud of it—to Ivy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath his engraved name, on the bit of social pasteboard,
as correct in Western convention as his coat, Sên
King-lo had written, “With gratitude for rice, and
always to you, Madame, with my homage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Gilbert looked at the card, passed it back—scarcely
touching it—looked at the flowers, then looked
at Miss Julia, trying to think of some pleasant and satisfactory
comment to make—she thought one was expected—failed,
and so “Thank you,” lamely, was all she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Townsend was simple in the best and finest sense
of simplicity, but what she knew she knew rather thoroughly,
and she was not inexperienced in girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you not like Mr. Sên?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve not said so.” Ivy flushed a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say so,” Miss Julia retorted with gentle decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” the girl demurred, “I’m not sure that I
don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not sure that you do,” the woman insinuated
with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is perfectly true,” the girl owned. “I don’t
know whether I like or dislike him. I hope I did neither.
I’d not care to believe that I either liked or disliked
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not, girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure I can explain. I—yes, that is it; I
resented him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Resented him?” Miss Julia spoke warmly. “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His color, I suppose,” Ivy said hesitatingly. “For
I can’t think of any other reason. I don’t feel as you
do, Miss Townsend, about colored people and all that—we
don’t in England. But still—I don’t quite take it
lying down, I suppose, when I see one of them, not only
evidently thinking himself as good as we are, but assuming
that we think so too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sên King-lo is very much better than most of <span class='it'>us</span>,”
Miss Townsend said quietly, “and far too intelligent not
to know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stared in astonishment. She was wordless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman laughed. “Don’t be a goose, Ivy,” she
advised good-humoredly. “And don’t talk about ‘colored
people’ as if Mr. Sên were one. He is nothing of the
sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is blacker than I am,” Ivy laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how would you like to be called a ‘colored person’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m not. And calling me so wouldn’t make me
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he is not one. And calling him so doesn’t make
him one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s Chinese,” Ivy persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who said he wasn’t?” Miss Julia persisted too.
“And—if I get at your meaning, and I think I do—you
think it inappropriate that you should associate with a
Chinese gentleman on just the same terms as with a
French or Spanish gentleman. Isn’t that it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a difference,” Ivy urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph!” said Miss Julia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think Uncle Lysander liked waiting on him,”
the girl ventured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed?” Miss Townsend spoke crisply. “I give
my blacks their orders. I am not concerned with their
race-prejudices, or disturbed by their likes or dislikes—so
long as they do not display them. And it never has
occurred to me to consult Lysander as to what guests
I should or should not receive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be angry with me, please,” Ivy pleaded. “I
only said what I did because you asked me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” the hostess admitted promptly. “And
I daresay you are not the only one that is surprised and
not too approving of my friendship with Sên King-lo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I hope I didn’t even hint that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t mean to, I’m sure. But you felt it.
And,” she added dryly, “you did rather hint that my
Chinese guest was not good enough for Uncle Lysander.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—” Ivy began—and broke off lamely with, “I
wish I’d held my tongue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t,” Miss Julia told her. “We may as well
get it clear. There are two parts to it: the very different
attitude of my mind to the darkies and to Asiatics, and
my personal regard for Mr. Sên individually. I love my
negroes, just as I love my dogs and all horses. In a certain
way, or rather in certain ways, I respect them—sometimes,
some of them. I respect their loyalty, when
they are loyal. (Mine have to be, or go.) But the best
of them are a cross between babies and useful domestic
animals. The negro race has no past, and will have no
future. It has certain knacks of mind, but no intellect.
It is of peasant breed through and through. Lysander
and Peter probably would be eating each other, or breakfasting
off Dinah this very day, and doing it stark naked
somewhere in Africa, if their ancestors had not been
captured, carried over here, and sold as slaves to my
ancestors. The nigger rose to his highest place and
development under the rule of the Southern master.
What’s going to happen to him now? One of three things.
Either he’ll die out, starved to death by his own laziness
and exterminated by consumption; or he’ll deteriorate
into a despised and despicable, contemptibly
employed pariah, crushed and wretched, his hand against
every one of us, and most of all against himself; or he’ll
ruin this country and exterminate <span class='it'>us</span>. He can teach us
nothing and the North-fangled teaching is going to corrupt
him and corrupt him very far and very fast. It
isn’t a matter of skin, I tell you, it isn’t a matter of color;
it is a matter of character, of mind and of social fitness—the
difference between the negroes and the Asian. Asia
can teach us a great deal. And some of us are just beginning
to suspect it. Sên King-lo’s ancestors were
<span class='it'>gentlemen</span>, and were scholars and statesmen and artists
when yours and <span class='it'>mine</span> were living in a tadpole state of
human existence. We have risen—you and I. The
darkies can’t rise—not an inch higher than they have.
We never—if we’ve got a sane hair on our head—can
treat the negroes as our equals; for the reason that they
never by any possibility or miracle can rise to or approach
equality. They can go down, in my opinion they
will—but they never, never can go up—any farther.
Many Asiatic peoples had ‘gone up’ very far when we
were still wallowing. Not many of us Americans know
this—or are willing to realize it. I happen to. They
are <span class='it'>different</span> from us. They are <span class='it'>not</span> inferior. Now,
about Mr. Sên—individually about him. When he first
came here the present running after yellow officials had
not begun. It is only a smart-set fad—like the tango
and indecently short skirts, or a dash of rum in tea—to
spoil it—we had that a few years ago, or eating asparagus
with your fingers. It’s only froth—and not the
creditable thing it looks. No one ran after him then,
or asked him to dinner. I had to. To be fair, I didn’t
like it. But I was in debt to him, and, of course, I had
to pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy was interested now—and looked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His grandfather saved my great-uncle Julian’s life.
Yes!”—for the girl’s amazement showed her almost incredulous.
“In Pekin. What my great-uncle was doing
there I don’t remember—something about some sort of
concession somebody wanted about something or other—opium,
I daresay, or tea, or tea-pots, or ivories, or
hemp—anyway, he was there. And you English were
there too—and not popular—and the Chinese didn’t see
any more difference between a nice simon pure American
like my great-uncle Julian and an Englishman than some
people can see between a woolly negro house-servant and
a Chinese gentleman. Two of the English got themselves
into a bad scrape of some sort; the Chinese locked them
up in a cage, and fed them through the bars, and didn’t
feed them particularly well or particularly much—two
Englishmen named—let me see—Lord? No—Lock—Lock
and Parkes—yes, that’s it; at least I think one was
named Lock, and I know the other man’s name was
Parkes. Well, the Chinese were going to do the same to
my great-uncle, and to cut off his head into the bargain.
I’m sure I don’t remember why, if I ever heard. And
they very nearly did. But a Chinese man—you needn’t
ask me why, for I’ve no idea, helped Uncle Julian to
escape, and sent him home to Virginia. His name was
Sên—Sên Ch’ang Tso, and his memory has been kept
green by all of us—we Townsends—ever since. And
when I saw in the <span class='it'>Post</span> that a Mr. Sên had come over
as a secretary or something to the Chinese Minister here
I went and called. They were not going to let me in—but
they did. The boy—Sên King-lo, was surprised at
my visit. Well, that didn’t matter. He was polite—they
always are—and I sat down and asked him if he had had
a relative in Pekin in 1860, a relative named Sên Ch’ang
Tso, and he said, ‘Yes, my grandfather.’ And then I
told him about my great-uncle Julian. He never had
heard of that. But he said he was pleased to have met
me—and I think he was—afterwards. And we have been
friends ever since. I asked him here, because I felt I
ought to—but now I ask him because I want him. He
had no other friend—outside of his own people—in
Washington then. Now he has more than he can do
with. But he never forgets me. He never lets many
days go by without showing me one of the small, pretty
attentions that mean so much to women, and mean most
to old, unmarried women who can’t be said to get the
lion’s share of carnations and chocolate creams.” She
sniffed at the flowers again, and nodded at Ivy across
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you—for telling me,” the girl said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what is it? You are thinking something you
don’t like to say. Out with it, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was wondering,” Ivy said slowly, “that Mr. Sên
cared to sing darky songs, and wondering if he quite
liked borrowing one of the negroes’ banjos, and playing
on it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia laughed. “That color question again!
Don’t let how that affects Sên King-lo trouble you. It
does not affect him at all. He may or may not realize
that a good many people class him and all his countrymen
with the blacks—probably he does. He can see
through a church door when it is open. But, if he
does, he leaves it for what it is worth. Sên King-lo
knows what he <span class='it'>is</span>.”</p>

<h1 id='t1672'>CHAPTER VI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>And Ivy tried to look convinced, and to do it
cordially. She loved Miss Julia. She was not
convinced, not even greatly impressed or interested.
The ramifications of the color-question—if it had
any, that seemed to obsess so much of worried American
thought, and monopolized so much of American conversation,
did not grip her. The color-question shadowed
Europe but lightly as yet. And Ivy Gilbert
was self-centered, and did not have a profound mind.
At home she rarely read the <span class='it'>Times</span>, and never the
<span class='it'>Spectator</span>, <span class='it'>Outlook</span> or <span class='it'>National Review</span>. And what
if, some time long ago, in the far-off outlandish place
where cherry-stones grow outside of the fruit, and even
the King—or was he the Emperor?—or the Lama?—dined
off puppies and mice, and drowned his wives in
hot oil if they displeased him, a man named Sên <span class='it'>had</span>
saved the life of one of the Townsends?—<span class='it'>if he had</span>, how
did it credit the Sên now in Washington? She could
not see that it, even if true, put the Chinese man she’d
met at Miss Julia’s on her own plane, or on one at all
approaching it—or that anything ever could or should.
But she loved Miss Julia and would not hurt or vex her
for a great deal. So she did her girlish best to look
what she did not feel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Miss Julia appreciated it. She was not deceived.
But she was pleased at the girl’s loyal docility and deference.
And what did it matter what the raw, not-much-traveled
young thing thought of Sên King-lo? Nothing
at all. So Miss Julia smiled affectionately at her girl-guest,
as she pushed back her chair and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, child, if you won’t have just one more
pop-over, we’ll go and cut the roses—after I’ve put
these beauties in water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And two hours later, Ivy Gilbert, her arms full of
roses, went back to Washington and her nursery-governess
duties in her cousin’s—Lady Snow’s—house in
Massachusetts Avenue, and Miss Julia was left alone to
put all the fat, heavily-embossed silver, the pearl-handled
knives, the precious heirloom glass, and the very thin
china back in their wrappings of chamois-leather and
lavender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Friday. The garden party at Rosehill had
been on a Thursday. On Saturday morning a small
thing befell that had not often happened to Ivy Gilbert,
and very rarely indeed since she had left England: a
man sent her flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy was surprised when a maid brought her the box,
dubious even—and she scrutinized the name and address
very carefully. But there was no loophole of blunder
in either. So she untied the silk cord, and lifted the lid.
Violets smiled up at her shyly and fragrantly—and
whoever had sent them had had the taste to send them
with an abundance of their own leaves—and nothing
else—but perhaps that good taste had been the florist’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She picked up the card with them and looked at it with
curiosity. Then dropped it back with a little sound of
disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The card was Mr. Sên King-lo’s. But nothing was
written on it—nothing beyond the engraved name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was not a little incensed. She felt that he had
taken an unpardonable liberty. It would be taking too
much notice of him and of his insufferable Chinese cheek,
to send the violets back. But she would not have them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She’d give them to Emily, the under-housemaid. It
was Emily’s night out, and no doubt Emily’d be well-pleased
to wear them. Then—she thought of Miss Julia.
Miss Julia valued the man, had said she was fond of him!
And she had met him at Miss Julia’s. No, she mustn’t
do that, much as she’d like to. And they were beautiful
violets—dewy and sweet. Well, they should have a
drink for their own sake—the fault wasn’t theirs—and
for dear, foolish Miss Julia’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The card and the tissue paper went into the wastepaper
basket, but the presumptuously sent violets went
into a bowl of fresh water. And Ivy carried it up to
her own room and left them there, for fear one of her
cousins should ask her who sent them. She’d have been
ashamed to tell. So the violets were more or less tucked
away in an inconspicuous corner of the English girl’s
room. And before lunch she had forgotten all about
them in the rush of the day. Saturday always was her
busiest day. Lady Snow made shopping rounds on Saturday
mornings, and social rounds on Saturday afternoons,
almost invariably, and household responsibilities
devolved on Ivy, in her cousin’s absence, that the British
matron never deputed when she was at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But today Ivy had visitors who would not be denied,
but refused to be barred out by the man-servant’s “Not
at home”—and when Ivy couldn’t come down, insisted
upon going up to her. And Ivy alone in the schoolroom
at the top of the house was almost as little pleased to
see them as she had been to see “that Chinaman’s” violets—but
not so surprised. Lucille Smith had a habit of
“popping in” at unusual and inconvenient hours, and
never on earth had been known to take “No” for an
answer. And Molly Wheeler had “come along” with
the Judge’s daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to go on working,” Ivy told them. “I
can’t go to church in the morning unless I get this blouse
finished. I’ve nothing else I can possibly wear with my
new coat and skirt—and no other gown fit to wear. And
I must go to church with the children. It’s one of my
charming duties. They wriggle and whisper all the time.
So I must get this done, and it will take me all my time.
So don’t expect me to entertain you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” Miss Smith assured her. “Where
are the treasures!” she asked anxiously, looking about
the small room apprehensively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evident that they had not come to call upon
either Dick or Blanche, and it was quite as evident that
both the girls were greatly excited. Perhaps Lucille was
going to marry George Hitchock after all, then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone to dancing-school with Justine, thank fortune,”
their governess answered, “or I never <span class='it'>should</span> get this
finished. I’ll have to sew half the night as it is. Thank
goodness they won’t be back for another hour or more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank the Lord!” Lucille Smith cried fervently.
“Ivy! Is it <span class='it'>true</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True? What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Sên King-lo send you flowers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gilbert in her surprise nearly let the new delicate
blouse fall upon the schoolroom floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who ever told you that?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody. I heard him myself, heard him order them.
I’m almost sure it was your name he gave, you he told
the man to send them to. Tom went to talk up Belle’s
wedding bouquet—she’s got such a temper, you know,
there’d be the devil to pay—right in the church, perhaps—if
it wasn’t just exactly as she told Tom to have
it made, so he didn’t dare order it over the ’phone or
by writing, and he was no end embarrassed, plumb
afraid to go alone—so I had to tag along. Well, when
Sên King-lo came in, I was mighty glad I had. Say!
he knew what he wanted, just how many, just which
sort, and about the leaves, and the box; he picked out
the box, just a plain white one, ‘nothing fancy,’ and
no ribbons. I hoped he’d stop and talk a bit, but he
only took off his hat and kept it off—My! isn’t his hair
smooth—and Tom was so fidgety I couldn’t make the
running myself. If I hadn’t held on to his coat, he’d
have bolted and cut out of the store. But I did hear
Sên King-lo order violets, and I’ll believe to my dying
day it was <span class='it'>you</span> he told the clerk to send them to. Was
it? Ivy Gilbert, did Sên King-lo send you violets? Tell
us this minute!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that what brought you here?” asked Ivy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet it is!” Lucille exclaimed. And Molly added,
“And you can bet big!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he?” Lucille begged. “Ivy, did he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he did,” Ivy said chillingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” Lucille cried. “Ivy—how perfectly scrumptious!
How heavenly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Senator’s daughter said chokingly, “You
lucky, lucky girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy regarded them gravely. “I think it rather an
insult,” she said smoothly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” both the other girls cried. And Lucille Smith
added, “Say, Ivy Gilbert, are you insane? Sên King-lo
never sent flowers before! Violets from Sên King-lo!
And you—” words failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gilbert smiled superiorly. “You are very much
mistaken, Lucille. He often sends flowers to Miss Julia.
He sent her a huge armful yesterday morning. I was
there when they came. Mine are just a handful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Julia!” Molly retorted. “Of course he does.
We knew that. She always tells you when she has flowers
he’s sent in the parlor, and everybody knows he adores
Miss Julia, and that she thinks no end of him. Why,
she discovered him, and mothered him too, a year or
more before he became the rage. Miss Julia don’t count.
And I think he often sends flowers to married women
after he’s been to dinner or a dance—he is no end polite—Sên
King-lo. But he never, never sent any to a girl
before! Ivy, you are the very first. My—don’t I wish
it was me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t a girl in Washington who wouldn’t,”
Lucille added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Gilbert snapped off her thread, and laid down
her needlework for a moment. “Lucille,” she asked
quietly, “would you marry Mr. Sên?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucille giggled. “I’d like to—just to see Papa’s face.
But I don’t say as I would, not exactly. You don’t have
to marry every man that sends you <span class='it'>marrons glacés</span>, or
orchids, or I’d have as many husbands as the late Brigham
Young had wives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucille Smith!” Miss Wheeler assumed a shockedness
she did not feel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—isn’t it true? And wouldn’t most of us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose it is,” Molly owned, dimpling happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t say I would,” Lucille repeated. “But goodness
only knows what I’d say if he asked me. My, what
a lark it would be! But I needn’t worry. He won’t ask
me. He won’t ask any of us. But, Ivy Gilbert, I don’t
believe but half the girls in Washington would jump at
the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy’s lip curled. She took up her blouse and re-threaded
her needle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe I would really. But it would be
supremely exciting to have him ask me. And I’d give
my eyes to have a flirtation with Sên King-lo. No girl
ever has—and a good few dozens have tried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy sewed on in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show them to us, do, Ivy,” Molly broke in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too much fag,” the girl replied. “I haven’t the
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there a note with them?” Lucille Smith questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ivy,” Molly begged, “tell us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What did you say
when you thanked him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not seen him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when you wrote?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh!” Molly bleated it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ivy Gilbert!” Lucille’s was a cry of reproach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must!” one of them told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You awful goose!” the other told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he send his card?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s see it!” Miss Smith demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t got it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ivy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I keep it? I didn’t want it. And our
wastepaper baskets are emptied twice a day. It’s one
of the things Emma’s most particular about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucille gasped. Molly Wheeler looked on the point
of weeping. “Weren’t you glad to get the violets?”
she wailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly was not. I was displeased,” the sewing
girl said coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You idiot! Come on, Molly; she’s hopeless. Let’s
get on to Kate’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do,” Ivy said cheerfully. “I <span class='it'>must</span> get this done.
And I simply can’t while you girls chatter, and sigh,
and ‘Oh!’ and ‘Ah!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might let us see them first,” was Lucille’s final
shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy made no reply. She sewed on quietly and busily
when they really had gone. But on the whole she felt
less affronted by Mr. Sên than she had. And she wondered
if she ought not, in common politeness, to send
him a line of thanks—formal thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls had envied her: that was clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If further acquaintance was Sên King-lo’s desire, Miss
Smith and Miss Wheeler had done more to accomplish
his wish than Miss Julia had.</p>

<h1 id='t1993'>CHAPTER VII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>If Sên King-lo had such a desire, he was scarcely aware
of it. And a Chinese usually knows perfectly what
all his own wishes are. There is very little that floats;
most is securely fixed in Chinese mentality and character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had liked her at Miss Julia’s supper table, and on
the porch after supper, better than she had liked him,
but she had interested him less than he had interested
her. In the garden, under the live-oaks she had
arrested his attention intensely. At the supper table
probing, not impertinently or even intentionally, but
just as we must probe any stranger with whom we speak
for the first time—unless character and personality mean
nothing to us, and to Sên King-lo they meant a very
great deal—he had found little to hold him; nothing but
pleasant girlhood and a touch of bitterness that, while
he pitied it, did not attract him. In the garden she had
charmed him and simply and solely because, as he had
told her, she for a moment had looked to him less un-Chinese,
or, to coin a fitter word, less dis-Chinese than
any not Oriental woman had before, or than he’d have
credited that any could. She, the tilt of her head, her
coloring, a look in her eyes, the movement of her fine,
blue-veined wrist, the jade-green of her straight-cut
gown, the scarlet peppers dangling charm-like at her
breast, the fan-used fern-frond, had made a sudden
picture of home to him. And Sên King-lo was homesick—sometimes
very homesick. And if she had looked to
him a little Chinese-like, and he had been grateful to
her for that, what he’d by chance heard her say
had quickened his admiration as no mere beauty of person
could have done—and Sên King-lo worshiped
beauty. In that he was true to type. Chinese religions
are somewhat a farce, a convention and not a force, but
the Chinese strictly speaking religionless, are intensely
and vitally religious, and they worship but two gods:
ancestors and beauty. The technical gods of China are
among its servants—hewers of wood, drawers of water—engaged
often by the year or the day, treated and paid
accordingly, punished when recalcitrant or slothful, dismissed
without a character if too unsatisfactory. All of
which the gods take lying down, and far more like unto
lambs than Chinese servants do, who often make the
welkin ring with their wailing and cursing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ivy Gilbert had inveighed against kissing and
being kissed she had spoken straight to the soul (and
the taste) of China, and the Chinese soul of Sên King-lo
had sprung to her in response. Sên King-lo was no yellow-tinted
“plaster saint.” But our Western habit of
kissing, meaninglessly and otherwise, revolted him as
much today as it had when his astonishment and disgust
first had observed it. And he had avoided it—always.
Girls, and here and there a wife, here in America,
across the Atlantic, in several capitals—well, Sên King-lo
knew that he might have kissed, if he would. A girl who
stayed away from a presumably pleasant gaiety rather
than receive a young hostess’ friendly kiss had intrigued
him. And that charm and approval held when he had
found less than he’d hoped in the girl at supper, and
still held. But if she had interested him less than he
her, she had not altogether failed to interest him, and
he had liked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had sent his violets (they’d cost a fraction of what
Miss Julia’s carnations had) with far less thought of
further acquaintance than of gratitude for the picture
she’d made—she and her gown and peppers and fan
of fern. For that and for one other reason. Because
of the picture she’d made, and because her name was
“Ivy.” He’d heard her called so—and it had made
an oddly strong appeal to him—a Chinese appeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had bought and sent the little offering of fragrant
flowers not from any light or sudden impulse—Sên
King-lo very rarely acted on impulse—but in quiet acknowledgment
of a debt; and because her name was
Ivy! Not very usual reasons for the sending of flowers—but
then Sên King-lo was Chinese.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one thing Lucille had gossiped truly enough. Sên
King-lo never had sent flowers to a girl before. And he
had done it this time without either intention or any
flicker of warmth. Just possibly the call of her youth
to his had sent its young, quick message through more
than he realized. Twenty-seven is not omniscient—not
even twenty-seven of the quicker sense and Chinese born.
He had known no “girls” of his own race. The many
he’d known of the American and, but more slightly,
half a dozen European races, had sent no message along
the nerve wires of his personality, partly because they
had both looked and seemed to him so utterly foreign,
and because they had not seemed to him altogether girl-like.
Miss Gilbert had had a hint of familiar look to
him; she had said a Chinese-like thing—the first thing
he’d heard her say—and if afterwards, she had not
whipped his mind into foam and excitement, he had
thought her maidenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had thought and sensed her maidenly. He was
twenty-seven. And he was a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And perhaps for this—certainly for something else—his
face warmed when the English girl’s note of thanks—the
merest, meaningless line—came to him on Monday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he read it he saw how much he liked this girl’s
writing. No other people take handwriting so seriously
as the Chinese do—put so much into it, read so much
from it. This was round, clear writing, individual and
decided; nothing Spencerian about it—as refreshing as
a cup of cold well-water on a very hot day—in a country
where almost all handwritings were disconcertingly,
monotonously alike. It was an attractive handwriting,
and he thought it looked like its writer. It pleased him.
But it was something else that brought a soft flush to his
face, a new look in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had signed it in full:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>“Sincerely,</p>
<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Ivy Ruby Gilbert</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Ivy <span class='it'>Ruby</span>! How strange!” he said under his breath.
And he stood for a time at the window looking out at the
opposite house, and not seeing it. Seeing a homestead
in China where the hollyhocks and persimmons that
crowded about it were almost as gay as the roof of his
birthplace, where the flamingoes filched coolness from the
tiny streamlet where the trout were pinkest and sweetest—perhaps
because of the tang of the citron and lemon
trees that hung over it, and the musk and mint and verbena
that clothed its banks, and the violets his mother
had loved best of all flowers grew in their delicate
millions—his girl-mother whom he had never seen, his
mother, at whose grave his father had worshiped until
he’d gone to her “on high,” his mother who had died
that his life might come: a service of motherhood that
gives a saintship of its own in China, where mothers
not so set apart are loved by sons as mothers are nowhere
else—a service that lays on a Chinese son a double duty
and joy—and, too, sorrow—of worship and remembrance.
His mother had been fifteen at his birth and
her death. And her “milk-name,” the name her husband
always had called her, and called her in his sleep
till he went to her, was “Ruby.”</p>

<h1 id='t2148'>CHAPTER VIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Gilbert had a far happier lot than a nursery
governess can count on. But even so she was not
quite as happy as it’s good for a girl to be, and not
nearly as happy as she’d have wished to be. There
were two things she greatly craved: personal happiness
and travel—travel actual and social, to go far off the
beaten paths, to see new, out-of-the-way places, to have
new, uncommon experiences. She longed for both all
the more and the more persistently because she thought
there was very little chance that either ever would come
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was actively unhappy, when she was, because
she had so little to spend on clothes—it sounds raw
and rough put so, but it is put truly—because she had
fewer “good times” than most of the girls she knew,
and (perhaps most of all) because she loathed the, in
itself easy, work she had to do. No work is easy that
we both dislike and must do. Ivy Gilbert was a very
inefficient and a very discontented nursery governess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that good-natured society neither her comparative
poverty nor her wage-earning in any way debarred her
from such social place and power as a girl may have.
And in America a girl may have much of both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Washington is an <span class='it'>omnium gatherum</span>. All conditions
of men and women, of all ages and of most sorts and
most races circle about the White House. But it has
its select set—the word “select” is its own, and need
not be analyzed too closely. Ivy had its <span class='it'>entrée</span>. To the
superficial few in it, who cared for and gaged such things
in the wrong way, her undoubted relation to the British
peerage “cut far more ice” than did the fact that she
worked—or was assumed to—for her living; and that
she lived with Sir Charles and Lady Snow and called
them “Charlie” and “Emma” threw a very becoming
garniture of ermine over her simple and not always very
new gowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To do the girl’s own common sense and practical intelligence
but scant justice, it was not the fact that she
worked for a wage that was, she thought, her cramping
detriment, but the shabby fact that she could not dress
on anything approaching a parity with the girls who
were her companions and friends. It was that that
galled her. And she did feel that there was some
ignominy in the small drudgery-way in which she earned
her living. A people who boasted Emma Eames and
cringed to Hetty Green could not consistently look too
coldly on a girl who earned her living in a superior,
if small, way; especially when every one knew that
Lady Snow’s cousin, Miss Gilbert, could be presented at
the Court of St. James any time she liked, if she were
in England and had the price (of credit) of the train
and feathers. And Ivy knew it. But she despised her
own line of thrift—if others did not—perhaps a little
because she followed it so lamely and sourly. Discontent
often breeds shame. The English girl had been
kindly treated by kindly Washington—handsomely
treated, even, but she always had felt an outsider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At home—in London—her own birth and environment
had perched her more or less on a social fence. And in
Washington her dress-skimp kept her so—at least in her
own opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy’s maternal grandmother had been the daughter of
an earl’s younger son. Ivy’s father had been a not too
successful tutor at one of the great public schools.
An uncle of hers was a bishop—Canterbury itself not
too remote a possibility—another uncle was a wealthy
cheesemonger; a third a briefless barrister. A cousin of
her father’s was a bank manager in Surrey, a cousin of
her mother’s owned and ran a rural inn, and his son
a fashionable seaside hotel. She had a score of aristocratic
living kindred, and others that belonged to the
lowest middle-class, a few that were frankly “trade”—and
retail trade at that. Her childhood had been
radiant, her girlhood anxious. Mrs. Gilbert had been
a woman of extraordinary ability, as had her elder sister,
Mrs. Snow. While Ivy’s mother lived the wolf that
yapped now and then not far from their door never got
nose or paw in. Cora Gilbert could make a delectable
<span class='it'>entrée</span> out of a bone and a bunch of herbs, a chic hat
out of a yard or two of re-dyed ribbon and a card of
safety pins; and she ruled her husband and ruled him
well—and always she had a laugh, a smile and a gay,
tender word for her man and child, and a handsome
serviceable umbrella ready and waiting for the rainy
day. But the mother died when the only child was
scarcely fourteen; and then slowly but surely the wolf
pushed in. George Gilbert was devoted and industrious,
a rarely delightful companion—but he lacked the sense
of proportion, was devoid of executive ability, had no
mastery of detail, and he had one crass selfishness, one
incurable vice. He lusted for books as its victim lusts
for dope. There was not a second-hand bookshop in
Westminster or Bloomsbury that did not know and welcome
him. And before Ivy was sixteen more than one
pawnbroker knew him well. He never borrowed, he
never begged, above all he never grumbled or cringed.
But he would buy books, new books and old books, big
books and little, cheap and dear. And not with one
would he ever part. They crowded the little home from
half-basement to attic—and at his death, when Ivy was
twenty, their sale at a shilling-a-volume average brought
her more than nine-tenths of her heritage and the first
really good gown she’d bought in six years. And though
she had loved her father both tenderly and ardently, so
aggrievedly had the girl resented the absence of joints
and frocks for which their cost might have paid, that she
grudged the sale of none of them and had kept for remembrance
only three or four that he had prized most;
and she had kept even them altogether out of a sense
of filial duty and not in the least because she had cared
to keep them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In England she had never lacked for invitations and
cordial welcome. But what’s the pleasure in that to
a dress-fond girl who has next to nothing to wear? And
Ivy Gilbert found more rasp than joy in favors and
entertainment she could in no way return. Her rich
and aristocratic relatives one and all liked her, courted
her even. Her charming, dainty ways; her quick, if not
deep wit; her radiant face; her exquisite voice, more than
paid her way—if only she could have realized it—but she
did not. Several of her richer kinswomen banded together
to give the girl a good time—two of them offered
her gifts of gowns and ornaments—and one of them,
her godmother, and a spinster, gladly would have
“dressed” and “presented” her. The good times she
accepted now and then, but the gifts she would not have.
Riding lessons, a very good saddle-horse and its keep,
she could not resist when her godmother presented them
on her fifteenth birthday; but that was the only breach
that generous, affectionate Lady Kate ever was able
to make in the girl’s pride. Pin money and chiffons, old
or new, Ivy would have none. She had inherited her
father’s adamant honesty. She loathed going without,
but she would not sponge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Friends and relatives of lesser purse and rank reached
out towards her kindness and welcome as ready and
cordial. But their simpler lives and homes attracted
her weakly. From some old-time ancestor—perhaps one
whose name she had never heard—Ivy had inherited an
inordinate pride of race, an affinity with luxury and
ease. Mayfair seemed to her home; Balham and West
Kensington did not. Her own equivocal social place,
the mixture of gentle and nobody in her veins, tried her
sadly. She thought of herself bitterly as a sort of social
mongrel. And she blamed and despised the grandmother
who had refused a duke and married an architect of
minor ability, less success and humble birth. The little
leasehold home in which her father had died—safely
settled on his wife at his wife’s own provident suggestion—became
Ivy’s absolute property. She sold it at
once. It little more than sufficed to pay outstanding and
funeral accounts. Fifty odd pounds, a handful of
trinkets, a shabby assortment of clothes she disliked, and
her father’s absurd assortment of books, were all that
she had in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had no lack of friends—sincere and eager-to-prove-it
friends. Several homes were offered her, and,
incidentally, two not quite desperately ineligible husbands.
She refused them all, and set her wits to work
as to how they and she were to earn their living and
hers. And Charles Snow—her mother’s sister’s son—and
Emma his wife put their heads together to outwit
Ivy’s. And where others, as ready but less skilful to
befriend, failed the Snows succeeded—measurably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They offered her a three years’ (and probably more)
engagement in Washington and two hundred pounds a
year. Ivy mocked and accepted. But she insisted upon
naming her own wage—and from that determination
nothing would budge her. “You shall pay me one
hundred a year,” she told her cousin Charles, “and
that is about three hundred more than I’ll be worth.
I can’t dress, as a member of Emma’s family must be
dressed, on a penny less; so you shall give me five fivers
four times a year. I shan’t teach the children anything,
of course—but they’ll be none the worse for that for a
year or two. But I can mend and make for them—all
but their smartest things, see that their faces are washed,
keep them from falling into the fire or out of the windows,
and, just perhaps, be useful to Emma now and
then, and give you the pleasure of keeping me out of
the wind and the rain. It’s good of you, Charles, and it’s
more than good of Emma. And I won’t slap them—though
I shall want to every day of my life. When do
we start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sailed in less than a month. The three years
were more than half gone now, but none of them considered
it a possibility that she ever would leave them
except to go to a home of her own. Lady Snow hoped
and planned that Ivy would marry, and Ivy herself
frankly hoped so also. But as yet it had not been
indicated to whom. She did her best to earn her
hundred a year, and she had succeeded better than
she knew: for both husband and wife had found her
presence a help and a pleasure. She did indeed teach
Blanche and Dick very little, and good-natured Emma
rarely would let her do any needlework for them; but
she kept them English, and she did both her cousins the
hundred services that a younger sister might have done.
She loved them both and she earned the love they both
gave her. She shared Lady Snow’s pleasures, as far as
a dress allowance of a hundred pounds a year enabled
her to do without too stinging a flaunt of poverty. But
five hundred dollars and an inherited deftness of eyes,
fingers and taste did not go far towards adequate dressing
in Washington’s smartest set. And she felt herself a
godmotherless, pumpkinless Cinderella; and she loathed
it by day—and dreamed by night of—glass slippers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Snow would have “loved” to dress her young
cousin; but did not dare even suggest it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Townsend’s warm friendship had been both a
personal boon and a social asset to the not-too-contented
English girl. It stood for a great deal in Washington.
The half-aristocrat in the girl thrilled and was grateful
to the entire aristocrat of the old Southern woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not enough. She envied other girls—not
what they were, but what they had—and, because of
what they had, where they might untrammeled go, what
they might untrammeled do. She realized how generously
and gladly good her cousins were to her. But
she felt that a degrading smirch of “service” clung to
her, as the smirch of restricted means clung to her garments.
“I Serve” was not Ivy Gilbert’s motto, and—because
of the plebeian strain in her veins—she had
no sense that of all mottoes it is the highest and proudest.
She felt her life dull. She was ripe for adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo’s violets had done more to reëstablish
her in her own raw esteem than all Miss Julia Townsend’s
warm friendship. From resenting those innocent
violets, she abruptly came to value them <span class='it'>because</span> two
feather-headed girls with great purses at their service
had so envied her them. Sên King-lo—a <span class='it'>Chinese</span>—had
put her on her feet. Her attitude to him was not altered,
not modified. But she was girlishly, if cheaply, elated
to have what other girls wished for and schemed for
and couldn’t get. She did not place the violets more
conspicuously in her room when she went down to it,
it never occurred to her to tuck a few of them in her
belt when she changed for dinner. But she threw them a
kindlier glance as she tidied her hair. Perhaps she
ought to say some sort of “thank you.” And the next
day, after church, she did. She wrote Mr. Sên a note.
She wrote merely:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'>Dear Mr. Sên King-lo:</p>

<p class='pindent'>How kind of you to remember—with such violets—our meeting
at Miss Townsend’s. Thank you for them.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>I. R. Gilbert</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It looked wrong, she thought, as she scanned it. And
after a little consideration she rewrote it—leaving out
the word “Yours,” and writing her Christian names in
full. The initials had looked curt. One didn’t say
“Thank you” curtly—if one said it at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She posted the note herself when she took Blanche
and Dick for their Sunday afternoon stroll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wondered if he’d reply to her note, and ask if he
might call. She hoped not. But she’d not mind Lucille
and Molly knowing it—if he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo did neither. She met him again at the
Ludlows’. He did not ask her to dance—though he
danced several times. She was sincerely grateful that
he did not. But he sought her out, thanked her for her
kindness in writing—and in accepting—his posy, and
chatted on until a partner claimed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She noticed that Mr. Sên danced exceedingly well and
that his evening clothes suited him.</p>

<h1 id='t2443'>CHAPTER IX</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Charlie,” Lady Snow said to her husband,
almost a month later at dinner, “I made a new
acquaintance today at Mrs. Ransome’s, and—I don’t
know what you’ll say—I asked him to call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You usually do, don’t you?” Sir Charles commented.
“Why should I waste words over so invariable a habit,
my dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly like to know people—what else is there
for me to do with you shut up all day over your silly
papers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not doubt you would find them so,” Sir
Charles admitted dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We both were lunching there. I found him interesting—different
somehow from any one I know. My
new acquaintance is a man, did I say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite unnecessary—but you did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma Snow laughed. She plumed herself on her
“affairs,” and lived in desperate hope that some day
one of them would attract her husband’s attention sufficiently
to wean him a little from his dense absorption
in the “silly business” his country paid him to attend
to—and incidentally had knighted him that he might
do it the more effectively in a country that proclaimed
its scorn of all such fictitious honors, but at the same
time received them with very marked favor and attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles went stolidly and attentively on with
his very good dinner. His wife raised her eyebrows—and
led trumps—at least she hoped that it would
prove she had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A perfectly charming Chinaman, Charlie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sir Charles neither dropped his knife nor spilled
his claret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most of them are,” he told her. “This canvas-back
is a great improvement on those we had last week. But
the sauce needs a dash more cayenne and more than a
dash more lemon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like the Chinese?” Ivy asked him quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much,” he replied. “Every one does who
<span class='it'>knows</span> them. They’re the salt of the Eastern earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you known many Chinamen—well?” Reginald
Hamilton asked his host a little superciliously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I lived ten years among them,” Snow replied curtly.
“I was sent to Pekin when they first let me pass my Civil
Service Exam. And I wish they’d left me there. But
after ten years—for my sins—they promoted me—to
Geneva! Yes, I have known many Chinese—some of
them fairly well. The more you know them, the better
you like them: bound to. By the way, Emma, ‘Chinese’
is a better word, more descriptive, I think, and better
taste than ‘Chinaman.’ There is one Chinese in Washington
I very much want to get on easy terms with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Scotland Yard special-branch him?” his wife
quizzed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that part,” her husband retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Sên told me—” Lady Snow began, but she never
finished her sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it Sên King-lo you met at Judge Ransome’s?”
her husband demanded, putting his glass down untasted.
Emma Snow had aroused her husband’s attention at
last—very much so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—it was,” she announced importantly, “Mr. Sên
King-lo. I asked him to call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” said Sir Charles heartily. “I hope he does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure to. He promised,” Emma Snow said confidently.
Charles had not taken her small news as she’d
intended him to, and had hoped that he would. But
she was gratified at the mild excitement she’d caused.
She’d hoped Charles would be annoyed—but, since he
was not, it was the next best thing that he was pleased. It
was his indifference that rankled—and indifference was
his constant everyday wear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll leave his card—some day when he knows
you’re out,” their guest observed. “It is one of his
affectations. He’s a bit of a jackanapes, if you ask
me.” No one had, or had thought of doing so. “And
he usually does. It has gone to his chink head the way
he’s run after in Washington, D. C.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles Snow crumbled his bread viciously, but
he took no other notice, for Reginald de Courcy Seymour
Hamilton <span class='it'>was</span> their guest—though what possessed Emma
to tolerate the fellow, let alone invite him, was more than
he could understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Snow had her reasons. They were not ungenerous
ones—and they were distinctly feminine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, Ivy,” she said, “you met Mr. Sên at
Miss Townsend’s, he told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you like him, Miss Gilbert?” Hamilton
spoke before the girl could answer her cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Townsend likes him immensely,” Ivy replied.
“I have only met him twice—very casually.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cracked, isn’t she?” Hamilton said pleasantly.
“Haven’t met her, though, myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are never likely to,” Sir Charles and his cousin
said promptly—to themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, by George, he sent you flowers though, didn’t
he? I heard so. I’d forgotten that. Perhaps he will
call when you are at home after all, Lady Snow. I’d
live in hopes,” Hamilton said in a tone that made Sir
Charles Snow’s right foot tingle. But Emma Snow
had little attention to waste on any one but Ivy now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sent you flowers, Ivy?” she cried excitedly. “You
never told me. When?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t put <span class='it'>every</span> nothing in my diary,” Ivy said
indifferently, not troubling to lift her eyes from her
plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But did he?” Emma Snow insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her cousin smiled coldly. She was furious at Reginald
Hamilton; she didn’t know why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Mr. Sên send you flowers, Ivy?” Sir Charles
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked up then, looked at him in surprise.
The question was unlike Charles Snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had ignored Emma—had been on the point of
saying, “Why not get any details you’d like from Mr.
Hamilton? He seems particularly well informed.” But
she would not put her cousin Charles off, or answer him
flippantly—she liked him far too well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she told Sir Charles, quietly. “Mr. Sên sent
me a handful of violets one day. They were beautiful
violets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I’d known that!” was Snow’s astonishing
comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whyever why?” his wife cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you, as well as Japan, designs on Shantung,
Charlie?” Ivy demanded, with a laugh into his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven help us!” the knight retorted. “Who’d
have thought you’d ever heard of Shantung. I wouldn’t
for one. That <span class='it'>is</span> a development! Are you thinking of
standing for Parliament, Ivy, when we go home? Or of
investing in a Cook’s ticket to the grave of Confucius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles meant nothing by that, and Ivy Gilbert
took nothing personal from it. Indeed, she did not know
where Confucius was buried. A number of people in
Christendom do not. And yet few bits of earth so small
have wrought more of human history, human letters,
human thought. And the centuries to come and the
peoples of the future yet may veer and swing to that
pivot, a crystal-tree-guarded grave in Kuifu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald Hamilton certainly did not know where the
bones of the old Sage took their long rest. But he shot
a look of impudent question at the English girl. She
did not see it, fortunately; nor did Sir Charles. But
Lady Snow did. And she wished they’d change the
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not,” Ivy told her cousin. “Neither. I teach
your children geography!” she reminded him with nipping
coldness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Do you?</span>” he shot back at her. “You surprise me
more and more. Emma,” he turned to his wife and
said, not jokingly, “I think, if I were you, I’d write
Sên King-lo a note—see that you get his name right—I’ll
show you how to write it—and ask him to dinner.
I wish you would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will, dear.” The wife was delighted.
Charlie did not often back up her social activities, or
much care who came to dinner or who did not, so long
as his dinner was good and he was not expected to interrupt
it with too much small talk, though he certainly
preferred the did-nots to the dids. Lady Snow was very
pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Gilbert was not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” she said clearly, “I’d wait first, and see
if Mr. Sên did call, Emma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Husband and wife looked at her in blank surprise,
and they crossed a question to each other’s eyes. Never
before had any one heard Ivy Gilbert veto any wish or
command of her cousin Charles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He promised to call,” Emma Snow said haltingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he will call!” Sir Charles pronounced. “A
Chinese word is the best bond on earth. I’d take it
before A-1 at Lloyd’s any day of the week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald Hamilton said nothing—though his big black-brown
eyes sulked, and, to Lady Snow’s relief, the
subject did drop then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald de Courcy Seymour Hamilton sounds an
English (not to say aristocratic) name—but it wasn’t.
At least its supporter was neither. He did not even hail
from Boston or—to drop down the social and intellectual
ladder very far—not even from New York. San Francisco
could not claim him, and New Orleans would not
have owned him. He had been born in Chicago and still
ornamented that village-city of inordinate mixtures when
he was at home. What he was doing in Washington
nobody knew, unless he did, which was improbable—for
no one had ever known him to do anything anywhere
except to take the very greatest care of his person and
clothes, and to spend as much money as he could contrive
to wrench from relatives—and others. He was very
handsome; a little too plump, a little too smiling; but
undeniably handsome, and his clothes were many, costly
and very beautiful. He spoke with what he flattered
himself (or perhaps one should say flattered it) was an
English accent—when he remembered to do so—which
was a matter of fits and starts, that made the prettiest
patchwork of his speech. A sentence that started off with
the broadest of <span class='it'>a’s</span> often ended off with a few pronounced
as the alphabet’s first letter is in <span class='it'>rain</span> and in <span class='it'>bank</span>. No
one had ever seen him without a flower in his coat—except
at funerals—and oftenest it was an orchid. There
was little harm in the fellow—unless intense love and
over-valuation of self be evil. The worst thing about
him was his parents. That is true of many of us. He
hadn’t a penny capital—of his own—but he had a sybarite
income (though it fluctuated) and large prospects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father was a sensational Baptist clergyman who
had made, and contrived to hold, a meteoric “hit” in
Chicago. Chicago likes character—even pseudo-character.
Of the latter the Rev. Joseph Hamilton had and to spare.
There were Chicagoans who thought him an abomination,
some who held him both a fraud and a nuisance, many
who thought him a joke—and Chicago loves its joke.
But his congregation adored him—more than perhaps
men should a man—a congregation of shrewd business
folk—wealthy, most of them, many of them with heads
as hard as the shell of their adamant creed. To catch
and <span class='it'>to keep</span> the affection and the respect of such men
would seem an accomplishment of nothing less than
genius. If that is true, Mr. Joseph Hamilton had a touch
of genius—of a sort. He was as thin as Reginald de
Courcy Seymour promised to be plump. His voice was as
sharp and hard as Reggie’s was soft and creamy. His
delivery was wonderful—more “dramatic” than would
have been tolerated on the Surrey side of the London
stage. He fancied his sermons. And those who carped
at their quality could not gainsay their quantity. He
fancied his “letters” even more. His people gloated
over both. Old men who had burned and shivered over
night at his diatribes, went downstairs in their pyjamas
(or more old-fashioned sleeping raiment) on Monday
morning to snatch the <span class='it'>Times</span>, <span class='it'>Inter-Ocean</span> or <span class='it'>Tribune</span>
before any one else could, and to reread the wonderful
discourse before they shaved and descended to cornbeef
hash or fish-cakes or spareribs and buckwheat cakes and
maple syrup. He had been convicted of plagiarism more
than once. His congregation didn’t accept the proven
fact. Gage him, sum him up any way you will, he must
have had magnetism—a magnetism that only some felt—others
it repelled. The wife of his bosom (the word
is but a figure of speech—they both were more than
flat-chested, each was concave-breasted—Mrs. Hamilton
the more so. She scooped in alarmingly, for her hips were
wide and her bones were big, and she did not pad. She
was far too proud and far too moral to do that) was
less popular than her husband—even in their own church.
Beyond it she was little known and less courted than
known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hamilton earned—that is, received—a very large
salary, and earned almost as much more with his pen,
or, as some nastily said, the pens of others, and not a
little by lecturing and publication in book form of both
sermons and lectures. Mrs. Hamilton had a very rich
and not ungenerous bachelor brother, a Chicago publisher,
a straightforward, sterling man who <span class='it'>had</span> ability,
if you like, for his country school-going had been brief
and scant, and from a business start as clerk at two
dollars a week in a Peoria bookstore he now was secure
in a fortune of seven figures. Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton
had two children—Reginald and Emmeline—and no one
made any doubt—unless the millionaire publisher did—that
Reginald and Emmeline Hamilton would prove their
uncle’s sole heirs. Certainly it never occurred to his
sister that her brother might rob them by leaving anything
to her over their dear heads. The Hamiltons were
devoted to their children and admired them intensely.
To be fair, both Emmeline and Reggie loved their parents
very much, and were proud of their father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald Hamilton did not intend to “hang about
waiting” for his uncle’s fortune. He intended to amass
any number of solid gold flecks of it as he went along,
but he had no mind to wait for dead men’s shoes. From
very youthful days he had determined to marry (and
manage) a great deal of money. The lady must be
beautiful, accomplished, highly connected—that above
all—but she also should be really wealthy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was what the younger Hamilton was doing in
Washington. An English girl with a courtesy title he
rather fancied, or a Countess, or Princess of one of the
old Greek or Latin families. “Mr. Reginald de Courcy
Seymour and Lady Edith Hamilton,” that would stir
Chicago, he thought. And so it certainly would! Reggie
was no renegade—he liked Washington, he liked to
twinkle in the capital, he intended to “do” Europe, and
to do it in luxury and elegance, but he had no other
thought than to shine permanently in Chicago. His
determination to select—he had only to select—a rich
and aristocratic wife never wavered or slacked until he
fell in love with a penniless nursery governess, whose
own family tree was as variegated as a Cheyenne dance-hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That he had fallen in love with Ivy Gilbert he as yet
only half suspected. But Emma Snow knew it perfectly,
she knew all about his rich uncle Silas, and in her British
innocence she supposed that Reginald had a solid bank
account of his own. And hence her welcoming and more
of young Hamilton that had so puzzled her, in some
things, dense-pated husband.</p>

<h1 id='t2804'>CHAPTER X</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo called upon Lady Snow, called when
she was at home, two days after the night that
Reginald Hamilton had caused Sir Charles’ right foot
to tingle and twitch under the dinner table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a week later Sên King-lo dined with the Snows.
Again they, at dinner, were a cosy party of four. Lady
Snow had wished to make the occasion a function, but
Sir Charles had asked her to do nothing of the sort. And
he had asked Ivy to make a point of dining at home that
night. Neither woman thought of refusing to do as he
asked. They both loved him too well—and his requests
were too infrequent to be resented or callously disregarded.
And Ivy was unaffectedly indifferent whether
she dined at home that night or not. If she had dined
almost tête-à-tête with Mr. Sên King-lo at Rosehill, she
could do so at Emma’s. And that Charles had spoken as
he had of the Chinese had made more impression on her
than Miss Julia’s warm laudation of Mr. Sên had.
Charles was a man. He had lived in China. He reasoned
and thought. Miss Julia was only a woman, and felt
more than she reasoned—“guessed” more than she knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall make a ‘grand toilet,’ even if Charlie won’t
let me make it a grand dinner party,” Emma Snow told
her cousin, as she gouged her spoon into her breakfast
grapefruit. “You can dress as much or as little as you
like, Ivy. Mr. Sên will scarcely expect an unmarried girl
to be gorgeous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After several Washington seasons!” Sir Charles said
dryly. “Dress as much or as little as you like—both you
girls—so long as you don’t undress too much. That
always puts a Chinese off—even one who knows that with
us it merely is virtue unabashed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t <span class='it'>you</span> be indecent,” his wife cried sharply.
“I’m sure my gowns never are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see that yellow thing you wore on Tuesday
taking a prize at a Quaker meeting-house,” her husband
retorted quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma dimpled. So Charlie had noticed a gown of
hers for once!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wear something friendly looking, something home-like,
as fine as you like, but nothing of the fireworks
order, to put a man off his food. And <span class='it'>be</span> friendly. That’s
all I ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two women stared in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you’d like to look through my rags, and
tell Justine which to lay out for tonight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might not be a bad idea,” Snow replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” Lady Snow gasped. “Would you like me
to have a few Chinese flags in the drawing-room?” she
demanded. “And the table decorated with red fire-crackers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not!” she was told. “For the love of Mike,
be good tonight, Em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew why you care so much,” she pouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” he assured her, “you wouldn’t understand
a word, if I told you all about it. But I have my
reasons, of course. I want Sên King-lo to feel at home
here. And I want him to come again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly old politics!” the wife said scornfully. But her
eyes danced. Probably Charlie would let it be a big
dinner-party next time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely!” Sir Charles confirmed. “Silly old
politics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took Ivy Gilbert longer than usual to dress for
dinner that night. She had so few evening gowns that
it took quite a time to decide which she would wear. The
white, she thought at first, because the self-satisfied
Asiatic had said how little he cared to see women wear
white. But no, that would pay him too much attention;
and, after all, she was not dressing for Sên King-lo, she
was dressing for Charlie. The green georgette was out
of the question. It was very much the color of that linen
thing she’d worn at Miss Julia’s, and to repeat the color
he’d proclaimed Chinese might indeed seem to pay him
too much attention. It would have to be the gray or
the red then. The gray was prettiest. The red suited
her best and was freshest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hurried her hair, and glanced at the clock.
Heavens! how late it was! That decided it. It would
have to be the red. The gray took at least fifteen minutes
and the loan of Justine to get into properly. She could
dash into the red in no time at all—just over your head
and it went on by itself. She dashed into the red, caught
up an ornament or two that suited it—a couple of garnet
bangles the children had given her on her last birthday—and
two inexpensive but picturesque hair ornaments,
and ran down the stairs, wishing she’d thought to find
out what Emma had decided to wear—not pink, she
devoutly hoped. Emma wore pink oftener than she did
anything else, and this red thing of hers and any one
of Emma’s half-dozen pinks simply would squeal at each
other—ran down the stairs, and almost ran into the arms
of Sên King-lo: a small social catastrophe his presence
of mind courteously avoided. But it had been a very
near thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went into the drawing-room together; he quite at
ease; a small flame in each of her cheeks, brought there
by an odd smile that had crossed his face as he saw her
in the well-lit hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English girl did not know that the vivid red of
her new evening gown was the exact shade that every
Chinese bride wears. And it was some months later that
Sên King-lo told her so.</p>

<h1 id='t2933'>CHAPTER XI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>When changing for dinner Ivy—a little cross from
an unusually hot schoolroom friction—had thought
to herself, “It will be a sort of lantern lecture on China—a
lantern lecture with the slides left out, I suppose.
I wish Charles hadn’t made a point of my dining.
Lucille would have jumped at coming, and Emmeline
Hamilton would have groveled to Emma for the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But China was not mentioned at dinner. And long
before the sweets Miss Gilbert had forgotten that her
cousin’s guest was not as European as they three. His
quiet repose was more English than Reginald Hamilton’s
broad vowels—and so were his manners. And she began
to realize why Miss Julia so liked Mr. Sên, and why Sir
Charles had so welcomed him. He was a sunny, considerate
companion, as free from “side” as he was from
servility. He talked most to Lady Snow, of course, but
he glanced oftener and longer at her cousin; and his
hostess saw that he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo thought the girl friendlier and more
interesting than she had been before, and he thought
that tonight she looked almost more Chinese than she
had done at Rosehill. The rings of garnet and enamel
that dangled in her dark hair, and moved with her head,
had more than a look of stick-pins, and her dark eyes
almost were almond-shaped. He liked that stick-pin
look, and the gentle constant movement in the girl’s
dark hair. But he made no mistake. He knew it as
accidental as the bride-red dress she wore tonight, or
the jade-green and the dangling pepper baubles had
been. Of a race that sees little of women who are not
belongings, or detrimentals, or peasants, yet Sên made
few misjudgments of women. He knew why Miss Hamilton
wore peacock feathers and dragon embroideries and
Japanese jewelry that she believed Chinese, and—like
half the girls in Washington just now—clattered as she
walked, with the noise of bangles she believed to be jade.
But he sensed that this girl was virginal, had dignity,
and thought her own the super-race; all three qualities
which he liked. He did not agree with her as to which
was the super-race. But he liked her for her own
conviction; he thought it a womanliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The table-talk was general, of course—only the four
at the small round table—and it was most of it impersonal.
But it was interesting talk, Ivy thought, and she
rose a little reluctantly when Lady Snow rose. Ivy
was sorry that dinner was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles Snow was not. “Don’t expect us in the
drawing-room quite as soon as is best politeness,” he told
his wife. “I particularly want to pick Mr. Sên King-lo’s
brains, and a secret or two, if it can be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo’s eyes sparkled good-humoredly. “I shall
try to be picked very swiftly,” he said to the girl as she
followed Lady Snow through the door he held. “To
Hecuba, Sir Charles,” he bade his host as they reseated
themselves. “My brains are at your service, and my
secrets too, if I’ve any that are mine only—but I’m
afraid I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I lived in China a number of years,” Snow said,
pouring the port, “as you probably did not know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên laughed. “But, of course, I did. We have a list—a
fairly accurate list, I fancy—at the ‘shop’ of every
official, and of every one else worth watching, in Washington
now, who has been in our country, or has interests
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure! I might have known that. But, I don’t
suppose you know anything about what I did in China—it
wasn’t much, and you were the merest child then,
still smelling of your mother’s milk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chinese face quickened at the other’s use of a
Chinese saying. Then it grew graver, and Sên said a
little sadly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have to grow old rapidly now, we Chinese who
love our country, and wish to serve her. I know what
year you landed in China, what boat you took there, how
long you stayed, much of what you did, where you lived
and went most of the time, who many of your Chinese
friends were. And that was one reason—only one—why
I was so particularly pleased when I received Lady
Snow’s note, kindly saying that I might dine with her
and make your acquaintance—for I don’t suppose we
count as acquaintance the few k’o-tow nods we’ve exchanged
at your ‘shop’ and mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—precisely,” Snow agreed. “Well—as you know
then, I must try not to feel too flattered by what is
purely a bit of detail work of a painstaking patriotism,
you know that I have lived in China all told quite a
lump of moons——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A year and seven weeks longer than I have myself—all
told.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove! You have been exiled as much as that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” the Chinese said gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Sên, a man knows his own country better—certainly
more naturally—than any foreigner can.
But you and I know that the old myth that no European
can know anything very vital about China, or the
Chinese, or understand either at all, is untrue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo nodded and smiled across the cigarette
he was lighting. “Tommy-rot,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parkes knew China—quite a good deal about you—and
Hart did, and Macartney.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo nodded again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there have been others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there have been others,” Sên King-lo said.
“And there are now—a few. We need more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you’ll get them,” the host said cordially.
“But if you don’t, I expect you’ll make shift without
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” Sên replied. “But it will take longer
to accomplish what we must.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much longer,” Snow added. “Next to my own
country and people, I like and admire <span class='it'>and trust</span> yours,
Mr. Sên.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chinese lifted his glass. “And next to my own
country and my own countrymen, I like and admire
and trust yours, sir,” he said, and drank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the Manchu fell,” Snow began when he, too,
had tasted his port,—“frankly I wish they had not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo smiled. “We all regret—some more,
some less—that they had to, all of us who love self less
and China more, I think. But it had to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly,” the other conceded. “I don’t own that
I see it. But we need not quarrel over that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>We</span> shall not quarrel over anything,” Sên said
simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t think we shall. Well—I hope that the
Manchu may come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” Sên King-lo asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Best dynasty you ever had. And I don’t like republics.
Don’t believe in them. And for an Oriental people—well,
in my opinion they smell to heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo laughed. “Do you think the Manchu was
a good dynasty in its last reigns?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” Snow said stoutly. “It gave you the two
finest rulers any country ever had—any country, bar
none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean K’ang-hi and K’ien-lung.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo smiled again, but he drained the glass
Sir Charles had refilled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty Sun-Yat-sens would not out-balance either
K’ang-hi or K’ien-lung. And I hope the Manchu will
come back. And I don’t like dethronements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve had a good many in China.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly. Conquering princes and warriors
have mounted, usurped, if you like, the throne of the
Emperor they’ve unseated—but that’s a very different
thing from a people voluntarily dismissing their ruler.
And when they do it at foreign instigation and chicanery—to
my mind it is without excuse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mencius taught ‘Killing a bad monarch is no murder,’ ”
Sên remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Mencius was, to my thinking, a bit of a Bolshevik,”
Snow retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo laughed pleasantly. That he did—at such
hot derision of the Sage, showed how tight Young China
had gripped him, how far Old China had lost him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate to see China a republic,” Snow insisted.
“And I stand by the Manchu. You will dislike my
saying that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is why you say it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. I want to start fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I thought, Sir Charles. But I do not dislike your
saying it, or even your feeling so. I think you are
wrong,” Sên King-lo inclined his head courteously
towards the older and host, “but if a man himself is
thoroughly sound, I don’t think that it matters very
desperately what views he holds. I believe that neither
an incorruptible man, nor any views he has, will do
himself or any one else much harm. For our weal or
our woe, the Manchu <span class='it'>has</span> gone—for a time, or for ever—and
we, we Chinese, must do the best we can for our
country, with things as they are. And we can’t very
well import an Emperor made in Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid! But you could choose one of your
<span class='it'>own</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you have us crown Sun-Yat-sen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the last thing I’d have you do,” Snow retorted
grimly. “But there are <span class='it'>men</span>—good men, in
China.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Sên King-lo agreed, noncommittally. “You
have started splendidly fair,” he added with a pleasant
grin, “and now you wish to ask me something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; that was why I wouldn’t let my wife have half
Washington here tonight. I wanted a chance to talk
with you alone—to find out several things from you,
if I could. You won’t tell me, of course. Your Minister
won’t, and you, of course, cannot and should not; but
I might gather something from the way your reticence
shaped—I’m an old hand, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Chinese laughed gleefully. He liked this
Englishman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shantung?” he asked, gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—not Shantung. I know what you and every decent
Chinese wish and plan and hope concerning the
sacred province. I wish it too, Sên King-lo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” Sên said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to know, if I might, how you—you individually—believe
that China’s regeneration may best be
brought about. You’ll pardon me the word?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I use it myself,” Sên said gravely. “I believe that
the foundation of China’s new strength and health must
be financial. Her greatest and sharpest peril is financial—most
specifically from her use of foreign money,
and from foreign financiers’ misdealings with her.
That is why I am keeping so long an exile, Sir Charles.
I am studying European and American banking
methods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ask to what end?” Snow’s face was aglow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We—many who think as I do—are earnestly anxious
to see every bank in China entirely in Chinese hands;
entirely, adequately, exclusively capitalized by Chinese
money and securities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God!” The table rang under the blow of the
Englishman’s hand. “You’ve got the right end of the
stick. By the holy Harry, you have! Accomplish that,
and you’ll accomplish everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men smoked in silence for several moments.
Then Sir Charles spoke quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if you know what my Chinese holdings
are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost to a yen, I fancy. I certainly know that
you are a rich man in China. And, too, that you never
have parted with a Chinese security, except to buy another,
even in our country’s darkest hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never have. I never shall. Yes, I’ve a good deal
salted down in China—a great deal more than I’d like
Lady Snow to know. She has a rare taste in diamonds
and no mean liking for lace and other chiffons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên’s eyes twinkled. “I’ll betray no yâmen secrets,
Sir Charles,” he promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow waved that aside. He knew that. Nor did he
think it worth while to remark that no confidence of
Sên King-lo’s would ever be even impinged on by him.
He was right; it was not necessary. They understood
each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want only Chinese capital in the banks of China,
and no control that is not Chinese.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None; neither a yen nor a man; Chinese capital and
Chinese shareholders only, and Chinese management and
service, from the managers to the ‘boys’ at the doors
and the coolies who clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely—but I daresay you’ll accept foreign depositors
well accredited and sifted, and foreign customers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Every civilized banker accepts any good
account that is not an enemy account, and buys and
sells to any who can pay his charges. We’ve no
scheme to run freak banks. The heyday of the freak
is waning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” Snow said—but with a touch of dubiousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we—we’ll accept foreign accounts, not court
them. It is Chinese money, Chinese-owned, that we
shall aim to attract.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such a Rome will not be built in a day,” the Englishman
told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor in too few years,” Sên agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to be among your first depositors,” Snow
said slowly. “I’ll tell you what I am going to do, Sên
King-lo; I’m going to hold all I have in China at your
disposal. I’ll throw it in as securities—I’ll float it into
cash, and deposit it <span class='it'>en bloc</span>, when your national banks
are ready—and I’ll deposit as well the interest you pay
me—we’ll <span class='it'>call</span> it a ninety days’ deposit—say until Dick,
my youngster, is thirty; that gives you a fairly good
run, if you get your shutters up pretty soon—and I’ll
bind myself and my estate to make no withdrawal, little
or big, after that, without giving you very long notice,
and, as well, I’ll hedge you well about against my doing
so—or my heirs—at any time of special inconvenience to
the bank. All I’ve got will be just a drop in the bank
bucket, of course, but even drops come in handy in times
of drought. My Chinese holdings are at China’s service.
And the execution of a good, all-Chinese banking scheme
would be the best service of China I can think of. I’ll
do a bit more than that: I will sell you—your bankers
or your nominee or nominees—any or all holdings of
mine in your country, and sell at a minimum price,
whenever you feel that you are strong enough to stand
alone—and see us get out. I’d like to be one of the
first to get in—into your banks, and I’d like to be the
last European to get out. But I’ll hold myself pledged
to go when you say, ‘Go.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you owned Shantung,” Sên King-lo said
tersely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I did!” Snow replied. “In the meantime,”
he continued, “if you care to avail yourself of a little
foreign capital, during the expensive and more or less
experimental preliminary months or years, I’d be glad
to have you use mine. It’s at your service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chinese are said to be unemotional. It is not true.
The upper classes—at least the men—carry self-control
to an obsession, and have made it a fine art; but high or
low, there are no stolid Chinese. To a man their emotions
are quick and extreme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo made no reply. He looked both imperturbable
and nonchalant, sitting easily there in his
perfect Western attire, carelessly turning a cigarette in
his fine yellow fingers, his eyes on the tiny cylinder with
which he toyed. His face did not change in any way.
But he did not look up—because his eyes were a trifle
humid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You offer to take a large risk,” he said at last, “a
very unusual risk. You know nothing of me. And what
if the Manchu, or some other dynasty, did come back?
We are scheming and looking towards a republican national
bank. Had you thought of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I had,” Snow asserted. “It is up to
China to decide her own affairs. I’d like to see the
Manchu back, but I’m not in any way out for it. If
you enjoy your Republic—well, it’s up to you. On the
other hand, if the Manchu <span class='it'>should</span> come back, they’d
destroy no good thing that you or any one else had done
for their country. It isn’t their way. They might
make you grow a few queues—but their revenge
wouldn’t go much further than that, I’m thinking. And,
as for my not knowing you, don’t be too sure. We have
an Intelligence Department also, however pigmy it may
be compared to yours. But, frankly, no, I do not know
much of you. You are a youngster. Whitehall has not
got its eye on you—yet. May never have. I do not
know you. But I claim to know your race and your
caste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have no castes in China.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense; there is caste everywhere—from Patagonia
to Greenland. And—I know your family. I knew your
father slightly. I knew one of his brothers better. I
knew Sên Wang Yat very well indeed—your father’s
second cousin, wasn’t he? I do not need to know you.
I know the Sêns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” the guest said quietly. But he looked
up now, and his face was not expressionless. “But—it
is extraordinary—what you offer. I wonder why!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’d like to know! I believe in China’s future.
I believe your bank idea is sound—the soundest! I am
fond of China. I like your people. Those are four of
my reasons. I have one other—a sentimental reason.
Some day—just possibly—” He broke off and struck
a match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên showed neither surprise nor curiosity. He felt
neither. That a diplomat and, as he knew, also a keen
politician, should prove to be, too, an idealist, was not
very common, but as he knew as well, it was not particularly
rare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He liked Snow none the less for it. All Chinese are
idealists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That this man “wanted something” in return never
entered Sên’s mind. He was not a bad judge of
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was anxious to have you here, rather <span class='it'>en famille</span>,
because I wished to learn, if I could—even a hint or
two—several things that I’ve no doubt you know. Well,
I am not going to pump you tonight, but I hope you’ll
come and see us as often and as informally—just drop
in, you know—as often as it does not bore you. I hope
it, no matter how completely I fail to make the pump
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will not bore me,” Sên told him. “It will delight
me, if Lady Snow—and Miss Gilbert—will allow
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all right—shall we go to them now?
You’re a great success with the ladies, I’ve heard it
whispered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo made a merry and contemptuous shrug
as he rose. “Yes,” he said, as he opened the door for
his host—Old China had not lost him quite!—“Yes—I
am quite the fashion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was almost asleep,” Lady Snow asserted with a
pretty combination of yawn and grumble, as the two
men came in. “Come, wake me thoroughly up, Mr.
Sên.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure,” he told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made a pretty picture, her husband thought, in
her draperies of peacock-blue and apple-green—how
much had <span class='it'>they</span> cost? he wondered indulgently—and a
discreet swarm of about half her second best diamonds—he
knew perfectly well what they had cost. And Sên
King-lo proceeded to amuse her gaily and devotedly.
But she saw his eyes sweep the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Ivy?” Snow demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming back,” his wife told him. “She said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some time passed before Ivy did. She had a book
in her hand then, and she carried it to Sên King-lo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you write in my confession book, Mr. Sên?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I?” he said as he rose to take it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles threw his cousin a cordial glance. She was
a good girl. She’d thought of that to please him he
was sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Sên King-lo thought so too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were right—but more wrong than right. For
herself Ivy Gilbert had no wish that Sên King-lo should
write in her confession book. But she knew how it
would excite Lucille and Molly, and how they’d enjoy
it and chatter about it. And that chiefly was why she’d
trudged upstairs and down to get the vellum-bound
volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I write in English or in Chinese?” Sên asked
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In both, please—use two places.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall obey,” he promised. “May I take it away
with me? One needs preparation and prayer for a
supreme literary effort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” the girl nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your own in it?” Sên asked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One has to set the ball rolling,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I look?” He turned to the first page, as she
nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What perfectly soul-scouring queries!” he jibed.
“No, I shall not study your revelations of your utmost
self until later,” he announced, closing the toy. But
the quick Chinese eyes must have caught one question
and answer, for he said, “So riding is your favorite
pastime, Miss Gilbert. Do you often ride here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost never; Sir Charles hasn’t often the time to
take me. Lady Snow’s lazy, she hates riding, and I
hate riding alone—with only a groom to follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” Sên replied, “if—after we are older
friends, Lady Snow would allow me to ride with you
some day, Miss Gilbert? And I very much wonder, if
you’d let me? Miss Julia Townsend says she’d ride with
me, if she were younger, and I have driven her several
times in my dog-cart, without a groom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve no doubt Miss Julia would ride with you in
a balloon—if you wished it,” Miss Gilbert said severely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy thought!” Sên retorted. “Shall I ask her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me be there when you ask her,” Emma Snow
giggled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me be there when you go up,” was Sir Charles’
request. “She’d go all right, I’ve no doubt of that.
She’s a splendid sport.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a delightful, wonderful woman,” Sên King-lo
added. “Will you let me take you, Miss Gilbert—if
Lady Snow will allow me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a balloon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for worlds,” Sên declined; “on a horse. I have
one that would carry a lady perfectly, Lady Snow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The chaperon’s as dead as Queen Anne,” the young
matron said. “And Miss Gilbert is one of the new dispensations.”
She spoke lightly, cordially even—but her
husband shot her a puzzled look. He knew—he knew
every tone and tint of her voice so well—that for some
odd reason Emma was not pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not!” Ivy asserted coldly. “I despise them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you—ride—some day?” Sên persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy flushed. “I am teaching most of the time, Mr.
Sên, or trying to,” she told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! And untrue!” Lady Snow cried. “Don’t
dare to pretend you are not at your own perfect liberty
all the time. My cousin helps me—when she wishes—with
my kiddies. You must see them, at lunch, some
day soon. They are dears. But Ivy is as free to junket
as I am—freer—and she’s a little cat to pretend she
isn’t. It’s one of her affectations—just to tease me.
And you need not lend her a mount—we have quite a
decent one, she and I, between us, just eating his head
off—a groom has to give it enough exercise to keep it
on its legs. I never ride except when my husband
takes me and makes me, because it’s one of the things
I do not care for at all. And Ivy won’t—because she’s
contrary. But Wolf carries her perfectly. So——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So—perhaps—some day—Miss Gilbert will give me
the pleasure,” Sên King-lo said, and dismissed it. For
he saw that Miss Gilbert had no wish to ride with him—and
he himself cared very little either way. He
turned to Sir Charles to speak of something quite else,
but Lady Snow spoke before he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you ride much?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fairly often,” he told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ridden with Mrs. Gunter? I think no one
here rides as well as she does—no one I’ve seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Sên said. “I have ridden to hounds in England,
but, except for that, I never have ridden with any
lady. Here I have a quick canter by myself, sometimes
at daybreak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How perfectly awful!” his hostess groaned—quite
sincerely. “At daybreak! Mr. Sên, how can you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are all early risers—we Chinese,” he told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sudden red pulsed into Ivy’s face. She was angry
that it did—but she turned to Sên King-lo, and said impulsively,
“When will you take me for our ride, Mr.
Sên?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whenever you will let me,” he answered quietly,
with a slight, grave bow. He showed no surprise. But
he was surprised, as her cousins were. They both were
gazing at her in almost open blank amazement. Ivy
rarely changed her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Sên King-lo made no mistake. He could not
imagine the cause of her <span class='it'>volte face</span>, but he was perfectly
sure that it was not that she wished to ride with him.
And because she did not wish to, he regretted that he
had suggested it—or she consented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next Thursday?” Ivy persisted. “But you won’t
ask me to be ready at daybreak?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next Thursday. Thank you so much,” he replied.
“The hour you prefer will give me the greatest
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten, then; before it is hot,” Ivy decided. Lucille
often rode at ten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to breakfast, Mr. Sên,” Lady Snow said cordially.
“We breakfast at nine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very kind, Lady Snow,” Sên replied. “I
will not be late.” But the invitation had pleased the
Chinese man as little as it had the English girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Play to us, Ivy,” Sir Charles asked presently, not
because talk was flagging—it wasn’t—but because he
particularly liked his young cousin’s music. But Ivy
would neither play nor sing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to put up with mine,” his wife told
him. “When Ivy says she won’t, she won’t,” and went
to the open piano. Emma Snow played brilliantly, far
better than their cousin, if not so sweetly as Ivy did.
Dress was not Lady Snow’s only talent. She had several,
veiling them serenely under a radiant frou-frou of chiffons—that
she did so, not, perhaps, the least of her
talents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your turn,” she bade Sên as she rose. “I know you
do. You do everything, don’t you, Mr. Sên?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not nearly,” he assured her. “Is Beethoven your
favorite composer?” She had played the Moonlight
Sonata. “Or what shall I play for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she answered. “I just happened to play Beethoven—at
random. Play something you like best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He chose Grieg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy wondered if he had seen her favorite composer,
as well as her favorite pastime. One was just above the
other in the confession-book. She wished she’d never
brought it downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not. Sên King-lo had as little inclination to
initiate a flirtation with Miss Gilbert as she had to with
him—even, possibly, a little less. He deemed flirtations
even more vulgar than she did—and he had no ambition
to excite jealousy in Lucille, or in any one else,
and no sore, young desire to prove himself, in spite of
poverty and schoolroom bondage, no social failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If he had seen, or known, that Grieg was Miss Gilbert’s
favorite composer, he would not have played any
music of Grieg’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grieg was Sên King-lo’s favorite composer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after that he told them goodnight. He bowed
to his hostess without offering to shake hands. But Lady
Snow held out her hand to him, and then Miss Gilbert
could but do the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo took her hand in his deferentially, but
more lightly, less lingering than she was accustomed to
have men do. Yet—as he did—from some indefinable
thing in his touch—it flashed across her thought that
that slim Chinese hand might not after all give a feeble
account of itself at fisticuffs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles Snow went to the outer door with Sên.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The celestial dragon, smoothly as a swan, carry
your honorable person on high!” Snow said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May lotus flowers grow from the honorable bones
of your distinguished ancestors!” Sên King-lo replied.
“And may your honorable grave be soaked with the
tears of an hundred sons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven forbid!” Snow exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they both laughed and shook hands, and bade
each other an English goodnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—cheerio. So glad you could come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly glad I could. Thanks awfully. Cheerio.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The East and the West get within hailing distance,
at least now and then.</p>

<h1 id='t3663'>CHAPTER XII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>It was not late the next morning when Mr. Sên’s
orchids came—to Lady Snow, of course. He sent
nothing to Miss Gilbert—but she could scarcely expect
her confession-book back so soon. One wrote in confession-books
at one’s leisure, and when in the mood.
That was understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if he’ll pay his dinner-call today?” Emma
said to her husband, when at lunch he’d remarked on
the splendid blooms on the table, and she’d mentioned
who had sent them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose he’s going to live here,” Ivy Gilbert
remarked rather unnecessarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose he is,” Lady Snow said cheerfully,
“but he’s sure to call promptly—Charlie said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?” the knight she’d quoted demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said the Chinese were punctiliously polite. It
amounts to the same thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my soul!” Sir Charles muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll go out calling tomorrow instead of today.
I’d be vexed to miss him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like Mr. Sên?” Ivy asked indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t dislike him. I thought he was good fun.
Do you, Ivy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is not my idea of fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor mine,” Sir Charles added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he doesn’t bore me—if that’s what you mean,”
the girl owned lazily. “As for liking him—I don’t
know him. I’ve met him three or four times. What
does that amount to? And, you know, my likes are
few. They don’t stretch to China.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor your knowledge,” her cousin Charles reminded
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy nodded contentedly. She was not interested in
China or in the Chinese; and she was not going to pretend
that she was, even to please dear old Charlie.
She’d be polite—for him—but surely that was enough.
“Wouldn’t you better put your orchids in the drawing-room,
Em?” she said, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I intend to,” Lady Snow retorted. “There is a
big vase full there already. I brought these in here
for Charlie to enjoy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, my dear.” He might have added—but
did not—that he did not care for orchids, except when
they were growing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I shall only have them in here at meals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The peripatetic orchids,” Ivy said gaily. “Well,
you and the orchids will have to entertain Mr. Sên all
alone, Emma, if he comes. I’m off to Miss Julia’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather think I’ll have plenty of visitors today—though
it isn’t my day,” Lady Snow returned. “It is
in the <span class='it'>Post</span>, and it’s sure to be copied in the <span class='it'>Evening
Star</span>, that Mr. Sên King-lo dined here last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Scott!” was her husband’s comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy giggled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Emma told her, “I did. Justine knows a
reporter. I never have any difficulty getting my nice
bits in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t do that, dear,” Snow said uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you wouldn’t. You’re a man. I shall.
I like them in. Marion Lawson will be green. He never
dined there <span class='it'>en famille</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t put that in!” her cousin cried. And
Sir Charles looked distinctly disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Lady Snow owned. “But I shall tell Marion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you will,” Ivy laughed, and the man retired
philosophically to his ice-pudding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have looked nice if he hadn’t turned up after
all,” the girl remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—” the other confessed, “I almost was in a
wee panic. But I felt pretty safe. He’d accepted, and
Charlie says their word is as good as another man’s
bond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time her husband did not expostulate or contradict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were dining out that evening, and Ivy hurried
back in time to dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she asked, as they drove away towards Fifteen-and-one-half
Street, “did Mr. Sên call, Emma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Lady Snow admitted, “he didn’t. But half
the girls in Washington did. Emmeline Hamilton called,
of course. She came early and stayed late. I thought
she’d never go. She stole an orchid. And when she saw
that I’d seen her sneak it into her vanity bag, she
simpered and sighed—like this——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy giggled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles told her, “You giggle just like a Chinese
girl, Ivy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She frowned with vexation. It was too much! Her
own cousin!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—” he had seen the frown—it was still light—“you
needn’t frown. Chinese girls have the prettiest
giggles imaginable—not a scrap like our women giggle—for
all the world like the tinkle of ivory bells. So
is yours. I say, giggle again. Can you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy gave him a dagger look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove!” he exclaimed, “I’m blowed if you don’t
look a bit Chinese too sometimes. Your eyes—or something.
And you do tonight in that gown, and with
those stick-pin things in your hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl bit her lip sharply. She was wearing her
new red dress again—she never had many gowns to
choose from—and the garnet rings dangled in her
hair. Charlie had seen what the Chinese man had
claimed to see. It was intolerable!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ivy Gilbert followed Lady Snow into the drawing-room
the girl’s eyes were still stormy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was on Tuesday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo called on Lady Snow the next afternoon.
She was out, and her cousin was with her. Mr. Sên
left three cards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Thursday he came duly to breakfast—five minutes
before the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his surprise, and then amusement, and not a little
to Ivy’s dismay, Sên King-lo and Miss Gilbert had
breakfast alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children, who as a rule shared and excited that
meal with their parents, were closely interned in their
schoolroom quarters, because of unattractive colds that
might, their mother thought, develop into whooping-cough.
A cable from Downing Street had sent Sir
Charles in hot haste and breakfastless to the British
Embassy an hour ago. His wife had danced a slight
but painful sprain into her left ankle the night before,
and was obliged to breakfast in bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gilbert explained and apologized, and led the
way to the breakfast-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên had the tact not to offer to defer his breakfast
visit. It would have been an enormity, of course, but
for some puzzle of a reason Ivy had half expected it.
And it had crossed Lady Snow’s mind that he might—but
she had not said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gilbert was annoyed, and still more annoyed
that she was. But her annoyance wore off quickly. Sên
King-lo saw to that as deftly as unobtrusively. He
greatly regretted missing Sir Charles. But he accepted
the small situation quite as the very small thing it was,
and set himself to dispel the displeasure that he clearly
saw, though Miss Gilbert felt sure that she hid it completely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought that this girl with the intangible but
haunting something of China about her, disliked him.
He did not resent it in the least. He himself disliked
a good many acquaintances. He was sorry for her that
the three small family accidents had driven her into a
tête-à-tête meal that he saw jarred. It didn’t enchant
him. He preferred looking at Miss Gilbert to talking
to her. But he scarcely could gaze at her in silence
from melon to preserved ginger—so he addressed himself
to chat away her ill-ease and displeasure. Why
she had elected to ride with him at all still puzzled him.
He was sorry she had, and vexed with himself that
he had troubled her with the invitation. He’d make
it up to her as well as he could. She should enjoy that
ride if he could contrive it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why she so minded breakfasting alone with Sên
King-lo was a question the girl herself could have answered
but lamely. She often had lunched alone with
a man friend, and as often had given tea in Emma’s
absence to a man she knew even more slightly than she
did Mr. Sên. If she could ride with this man, it was
no great odds to break her cousin’s bread with him.
Uncle Lysander’s smoldering disapproval at her elbow
might have disconcerted her a little perhaps—for, while
it angered her, she must have somewhat sympathized
with it. It is not pleasant, unless one is very self-sure
indeed, to feel that the servant who offers you cutlets
and omelette considers you bad form. But the Snow
servants—except Justine—were all English, and it was
evident that neither Dawson nor William saw any indignity
in bending over Mr. Sên’s chair. She did not
know why she disliked this breakfast so—but she did.
Unreasonable, perhaps. But the fact stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all his intelligence Sên King-lo was at fault in
his explanation of the displeasure he recognized. It
did not occur to him that this English girl did not object
to breakfasting alone with <span class='it'>him</span>, but with <span class='it'>a Chinese</span>.
He put it all down to a personal dislike of him personally.
It did not vex him in the least. Had he
believed that she thought him beneath her—which he
did not—it would not have vexed him. Had he realized
that it was the Chinese race that she looked down upon
and considered socially unfit, it would have vexed him
as little. Sên King-lo, the sash-wearer, was even more
sure, far more sure, of his race than he was of himself.
His estimate of self was humble. His estimate
of China was very proud. He was proud and joyous
to be Chinese.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They breakfasted briefly, but before he moved back
her chair, Ivy had confessed to herself that the West had
done this stranger within its far gates well—for, if Mr.
Sên never had seen a Chinese girl, he exquisitely knew
how to treat an English girl, and how to care for her
tiniest comforts. And she complimented Western sojourn
and example for what centuries of Chinese breeding
had given—as nothing else can.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went to their waiting horses, outwardly cordial,
but inwardly each was a little perturbed. Ivy very
much doubted if he could ride—what she called ride.
He dressed the part without fault, which she always
had thought that only a British man could do—but,
after all, it was much a matter of tailor and boot-maker;
no doubt Mr. Sên had a London tailor. Sên wondered
how well his companion could ride. He loved to <span class='it'>go</span>.
Never mind—he reproached himself—this was <span class='it'>her</span> ride,
and, if she couldn’t ride, they’d walk. And she should
enjoy herself—this girl with his mother’s name—who
was starting off, he knew, so reluctantly. Why, he
wondered again, was she going at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could mount—that was his first discovery. She
rose a feather-weight from his hand. Her discovery was
that her unusual escort could mount her at all. That he
did it expertly was a pleasant surprise. And she realized
that his slender hand had been rock-firm under her
foot. It was a good beginning at least. In the pleasure
of even that small relief she smiled down at him graciously
as he straightened her habit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Mr. Sên,” she laughed, “you must have
mounted many girls. I thought from what you said
the other night that you scarcely had ridden with one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed back at her, lingering a moment at her
bridle. “I never have ridden with one, Miss Gilbert—never
with any girl. But I have mounted a great
number of ladies—one any number of times—no less a
personage than a duchess—the Duchess of Westershire.
So, you see, I’ve had distinguished practice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” the English girl cried. “The Duchess of
Westershire must weigh fourteen stone, if she weighs
an ounce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearer forty, I’d wager.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t tell me she can ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She can mount,” Sên insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t she crack your hand in two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Went up like down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she ride to hounds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She rode towards them,” Sên stated guardedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy chuckled. And Sên King-lo swung up into his
saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a better beginning than Miss Gilbert realized.
Make a Chinese laugh, or help him to laugh, and his
world is yours—at least for the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They eyed each other’s horsemanship guilefully.
There was nothing for either to cavil at yet. The girl’s
seat was perfect. Sên’s was no less.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still he was cautious. The groom behind heard them
laugh more than once—but it was she who suggested, as
they turned into Dupont Circle, “A little faster?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Sên King-lo set but a moderately quickened pace.
They still were keeping it so when they met Miss Smith
face to face. But he had no doubt now that this girl
could ride, and her English eyes, almost as quick to
horsemanship as his were to most things, knew that
Sên King-lo rode as well as a Derby jockey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, if he rode today to please a girl who—he thought—disliked
him, Sên King-lo rode to win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode far, and after the banks of Rock Creek they
pushed on into the country, and rode faster and faster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How joyous!” she called to him once, in a camaraderie
that knew no race distinctions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glorious, isn’t it!” Sên answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ride better than Charles does even,” she told
him blithely; “and you ride our English fashion. You
rise in your saddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I learned to ride in England when I was a boy
at school,” he explained. “But I usually ride American
fashion when I jog off by myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” she asked quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I enjoy it more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” the girl said, a little disdainfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to try it,” he ventured. “Don’t you
think it prettier?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the English girl would not own that. “Our way
is the kinder,” she insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the nags? Yes,” Sên agreed, “it certainly seems
so. But your cavalrymen did not rise in their stirrups
until recently. You should try it—sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like learning new ways, Mr. Sên.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or languages?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t call Chinese a new language, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be to you,” he retorted. “By the way,
there are a great many distinct Chinese languages, nearly
sixty. I wonder which you’d admire—least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horrors!” the girl cried. But she laughed softly—because
he had said “least” when she’d thought he was
going to say “most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he laughed back at her, because the speed they’d
gone was tingling in his blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Sên,” she said, as they stood waiting
for Dawson or William to open the door. “I have so
enjoyed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly?” He asked it gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve loved it,” she told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder then,” Dawson heard him say, “if you’ll
let me take you again some day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love it,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chinese man gave her a grateful look. It was
sincere. He was grateful that a girl who disliked him,
had had—as he knew she had—a good time. And he
was gratified that he had done what he had tried to
do. Sên King-lo was very human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon he sent Lady Snow a wealth of flowers—a
note of condolence for her accident, all fragrant
with their perfume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this time Ivy too had her tribute, tea-roses, and
on the card he sent with them Sên King-lo had written a
word: “Thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Miss Gilbert took her blossoms to her own
room. There were flowers enough in the drawing- and
sitting-rooms, and Emma’s room looked like a flower-show.
Ivy put her roses in water—one bud she tucked
in her gown. She was fond of tea-roses.</p>

<h1 id='t4081'>CHAPTER XIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>As he walked his horse slowly back to his rooms, Sên
King-lo, thinking the morning over, concluded that
he liked the girl he had just ridden with very much indeed.
And he began to suspect that she was more interesting
than he had thought her. They had not said a
great deal to each other this morning—and none of it
even remotely profound. He had had to make all the
conversational running at breakfast; and on horseback,
when the pace is swift, as most of their long ride had
been, is not provocative or well calculated for profound
or subtle conversation. But a thought-straw or two
from the chaff of her small talk had pointed, he thought,
to a mental equipment less ordinary than he had suspected.
And she had seemed even younger today—looked
younger too, in the searching early light, though
less Chinese in her businesslike English riding gear
than she had to him before—and she had seemed to him
intrinsically young each time they had met—as untraveled
twenty-two usually does to traveled twenty-seven.
Youth appealed to Sên King-lo. Being Chinese,
deeply and typically so, he sincerely reverenced age,
felt for it unaffected affection; but it did not lure him—and
he was in no way un-Chinese in this. Her youth
appealed to his. Next to beauty, what lured him most,
as they most lure all of his race, were loyalty, breeding
and pluck—probably the first and the last because they
tune and key with the loyalty that is deep-grained in
most Chinese, and with the pluck that is innate in them
all. Her reserve had seemed to him from the first a trait
of breeding, in no way a trait of shyness. In truth,
Ivy Gilbert had less claim to the title of “sash-wearer”
than he had—and less than he thought she showed. Her
birth was far less aristocratic than his, not so much
because his ancestors had been noble and distinguished
for untarnished centuries when hers were wading wode-clad
or wodeless in the unreclaimed marshlands of
Thorney, as because many a plebeian ancestor had contributed
to her being, and not one to his. So far back
that she barely knew it, and thought of it as the long-off,
hazy thing it was, there had been strawberry-leaves in
Ivy Gilbert’s ancestry, but both they and their bar
sinister smelt strongly of fish now—not the salt, fishy
tang of scaled giants caught with peril and prowess,
but the staler smell of fish in shrouds of parsley and ice
on tradesmen’s marble slabs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy’s ancestry was as weird a patchwork as was ever
a New England quilt. Sên King-lo’s was one almost
royal blue. And it had no bar sinister. There are few
bar sinisters in China. Perhaps the Chinese manage
man’s wide-flung proclivities more wisely than we do.
It could be argued. Certainly they punish little children
for prenatal happenings less than we do. They
suffer them all to come welcomed and desired into life,
suffer them all to wear with untainted right their
father’s name—and, not less a boon and a gladness, to
love their mothers and be loved by their mothers unashamed.
The twenty little flags of British preference
and prejudice she’d fluttered out, scarcely with cause,
each time they’d met, he took for a young and feminine
display of a loyalty that was both sound and sweet.
He liked her for it. Her open affection and pride for
her cousin Charles, he liked her for, even more. Chinese
loyalty has been for its thousands of years far more
a thing of family and clan than of country or race—and
Young China has had scant time to alter that
yet; and it was not altered in Sên King-lo. Her good-natured
and sunny treatment of him—so disliking him—he
was very sure she disliked him—seemed to him
both good-breeding and pluck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a point he was right. It had been both—at first.
For some quirk or reason—he, try as he would, could
not yet fathom what it was—she had ridden with him
sorely against her inclination, and having done it of
her own untrammeled determination—or freak—she had
paid the small social debt it obligated in sunny, good
humored companionship; too socially honest, too well-bred
to default. Sên King-lo liked her for that. Her
honesty appealed to him—true son that he was of a race
that must, to a man, pay <span class='it'>all</span> its debts in full at least
once a year. Of how many peoples can that be said?
And again, Sên was right, up to a point. The girl
was too well-bred, too socially honest, having gone with
him voluntarily, to treat him sourly or over-stiffly, and
not to do so <span class='it'>had</span> taken pluck—at first. And he liked
her for riding so well, as any man who was horse-fond
must have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes—he liked her. He liked her, of the women he
knew here, next to Miss Julia Townsend, perhaps. And
he certainly liked her very much more than he did even
the least unlikeable of the unmarried girls and matrons
who banded together to “run after” him—a free, if not
easy, inter-racial attention that Sên King-lo valued the
tawdry freak thing it was. It both had amused and had
bored him. But it never had flattered him. For the
quality of her liking, her friendship, her kindness,
King-lo loved Miss Julia. But for no one else in
Christendom had he ever felt any affection, until something
of that feeling suddenly had sprung in him as
he sat alone in the dining-room with Sir Charles Snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This young Chinese was as little given to sudden
likings as the slow-to-decide Englishman was. But
there are affinities of manliness and of tastes that brook
no delay, that defy barriers. And the quick and sure
Chinese intuition of the younger man had leapt to
Snow’s worth and congeniality almost on the instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now and then, across the stretch of East and West,
there are hands that touch, and having touched, clasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo did not like Miss Gilbert—the girl with
the Chinese-like flower names—the less because she
was Charles Snow’s cousin, or that the cousinly bond
between them so evidently was strong and close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing, at least, Sên disliked in his new girl-acquaintance:
the little she seemed to care for her small
cousins. He had not seen her with them—or seen them
at all—and he hoped her indifference to them was
merely a verbal barrage to screen and defend from a
stranger, a sentiment too exquisite to be shown to a
passing acquaintance, above all not to one whom she
disliked. He hoped that—for the sake of his new ride-born
liking of her—but he rather doubted it. He
thought her pluck was more than her artifice; her indifference
had rung true enough. And to his Chinese
thinking even the slight ailment that kept her little
cousins prisoners in their own rooms would have been
sufficient excuse for the kinswoman, who had an almost
maternal office over them, to have denied herself
to him altogether this morning, and have sent him and
his horse away from the door. They might be suffering,
the poor little tender things—and yet she had laughed
and galloped, and her color had deepened joyously, and
her brown eyes sparkled care-free and happy. Was
she callous?</p>

<p class='pindent'>All Chinese adore all children. Nothing else in our
West so repels them as that there are among us
some that do not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hoped he was wrong—she had seemed fond of her
horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had tubbed again, Sên had his lunch-chop
and hock alone. Washington is as “dry” now as an
autumn leaf in drought-time, of course; and was then.
But there still are cellars in Washington. In his own
house a man, and his guests, may do as he likes with
his own. It seems unlikely to be so long, but it is
measurably so now. And the Chinese Legation had its
cellar—a very good cellar, though rarely broached except
on “guest-nights”; and Sên had its freedom. He would
not have bought hock now, imported since 1914. He
did not relish Colonial wines. But the hock that had
been bought and paid for—he feared it had been paid
for—before the War, he drank and enjoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no new thing for Sên to eat alone. For so
popular and courted a man, he spent a great deal of time
in his own nook—his oak well-sported. And for so busy
a man, he seemed to have, or to make himself, a great
deal of leisure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be alone, and to be at leisure rather frequently,
was a necessity of his Chinese being. He spoke three
European tongues idiomatically, and almost without
accent. He spoke English so well that when he did, he
thought in English. A very rare and delicate feat that!
He could do most things that Englishmen could do, and
some of them he did better than many Englishmen
could. His Western on-growths were genuine and vigorous.
But they all were graftings. No sap of them
had permeated backwards into the trunk or core of
his nature. In all of them some Chinese sap flowed
and tinged. Sên King-lo was thoroughly Chinese—as
essentially Chinese as if he never had left the Ho-nan
home of his birth. It is in solitude, communing with
self, communing more with Nature, that every Chinese
takes his spiritual ease, has his spiritual growth, leads
his intensest, truest life. It is then that he lives—even
more than when he sits with his hand on his mother’s
girdle, or his children’s hands on his skirt. Except
the most toil-stunted of the working-class, every Chinese
must be alone sometimes, or perish. And even the
work-driven coolie, who labors and toils and reeks in
his sweat almost from dawn to dawn, snatches a soul-breather
now and then, alone with his pipe, or a growing
flower, a bamboo clump, a rushing river’s bank, a bird
on a bough. He must.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Chinese criminal on his way to the indescribable
execution ground, will lag a moment to buy a flower,
and sniff at it joyously, as he trudges on to his hideous
death. Give any Chinese child its choice between a toy
and a graceful spray of sweet-scented honeysuckle, invariably
it takes the blossoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And every Chinese—young or old, rich or poor—knows
how to be alone, makes solitude a dignity, and
gives it charm, and reaps from it—much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo did not go out again that day or evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had lunched—he had called at the florist’s on
his way home, and had written his note to Lady Snow
at his club, before he went to New Hampshire Avenue—he
curled up on a divan with a book—poems that
Po-Chii-i had written eleven hundred years ago. He
read slowly and steadily—pausing to dream now and
then—reading many verses over and over—while the
pleasant noises of Washington droned unheeded in at
his wide-open window, and he did not lay Po-Chii-i’s old
singing aside till Kow Li brought in his tea: true Chinese
tea that can be bought in no Western shop. But Sên
made no ceremony of his tea-drinking, though it cost
him neither cream nor sugar. And he munched a
toasted, buttered muffin and two plump éclairs to the
last crumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Kow Li had cleared away the small tea-service,
Sên sat, until it was time to change for dinner,
almost without moving in his easy-chair—and thought.
It’s a Chinese habit—the breath of the Chinese mind. A
Chinese must meditate—or die. Even the babies, and
the shrill-tongued babbling women, meditate in China.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where there is no vision the people perish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though he was dining alone in his own sitting-room,
Sên dressed for dinner as scrupulously as if he’d been
an English subaltern alone in a remote dâk bungalow
about to dine off half-roasted but wholly grown goat and
undergrown plantains, washed down by criminal and
luke-warm beer. There was not a little of the English
gentleman in Sên King-lo, not a few English characteristics,
habits and traits that in no way clashed with
Chinese—or that were Chinese as well. And there were
a number of Western superficialities that he preferred to
their Eastern substitutes. He not only liked silver forks
better than he did ivory chop-sticks, and glass finger-bowls
better than a steaming wet towel, and preferred
mattress, blankets, sheets and soft pillows, to a mat
and a hard cylinder pillow—though in England, and
when well dog-tired after a hunting day, he more than
once had sat up all night, in protest against the feather-bed
his hostess had assigned to him—but he had grown
so accustomed to English clothes that he no longer
realized how much more comfortable, and in most ways
preferable, were the men’s garments of old Pekin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his after-dinner cigarette, Sên remembered the
confession he’d promised to make—in a book. Where
was it? Kow would know, and when Sên rang, Kow
did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên made himself very comfortable in his biggest arm-chair,
and leisurely studied the book. In a way, it
proved better worth the trouble than confession-books
often do. Ivy had passed it about with discrimination.
A number of distinguished men, and one or two such
women, had written in it; notables whose acquaintance
she had owed, no doubt, to Sir Charles. As he read
and studied, Sên grew really interested. His “mea
culpa” was going into uncommonly good-fellowship.
There was not a nobody there! Unless Miss Gilbert herself
was “no one.” Certainly Julia Calhoun Townsend
was not even remotely a nobody. And almost every
other name signatured there was known and reputed
beyond both the width and the length of the Potomac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled reverently at Miss Julia’s spidery tellings—and
read them twice for their perfume of a sweet and
aromatic personality. Ivy’s own “confession” was naïve
and girlish—written several years ago on the birthday
the book had been given her. But it surprised even more
than it interested him. It interested him even more than
he knew. His browsing of it outlasted an entire cigarette;
and Sên smoked slowly. Yes, the girl was interesting,
and very much more intelligent than he had
supposed. He wondered if many English girls of sixteen—the
book told him that she’d been sixteen when
she received it six years ago—were so intelligent and
so out of the ruts. He looked at the date her “confession”
gave, and he made a mental note of it. Then he
thought better of that, and penciled a note on his cuff.
But what surprised him most—and it amused him—was
that several of her answers were identical with those
he’d write in a few moments—if he wrote quite truly.
So Grieg was her favorite composer as well as his own.
There were several pastimes that he cared for even
more than he did riding. But Velasquez and Turner
were his favorite painters—of Western ones. Miss Gilbert
could not be expected to have heard of Ma Yuen—much
less to have seen even one of his silks. And he
too preferred Thackeray to Dickens. Lemon-yellow was
the color that too pleased him most. The harp was also
his favorite instrument. Spain was not the country he
most wished to see—for he had seen Spain, had spent
almost a year there. What she most disliked was vulgarity
and disloyalty. That was true of him. He
thought best of the living reigning monarch of whom she
did. Really—the thing was a little ridiculous. She
liked prose better than she did poetry—well, that was
one escape. And there were other safety-valves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose with a light laugh, and carried the telltale
volume to his writing-table—a table of hybrid impedimenta;
for Sên King-lo usually brushed the letters he
wrote to China; and he had no intention of forgetting
to write his own language in the old Chinese way in
which Tu Fu and Li T’ai Po and his own father had
written it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found his vacant pages; a pair that followed a
pair, and dipped his brush in the ink. And when he also
had written in English and the last page was dry, he
closed the book, and strolled to the still-open window.
He’d send Kow Li with the book tomorrow. He had
kept it long enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a woman wants, she wants quickly. Only
men have the strength to wait.” Which of the philosophers
had said that? Odd, he’d forgotten—but he had.
Kow should carry the book back tomorrow, and ask for
news of Lady Snow’s hurt, and of her children’s colds.
He wished he had not sent those tea-roses today. Lilies-of-the-valley
were her favorite flowers—a flower she
never had seen was his. He’d like to send her valley
lilies with her book. But you couldn’t send tea-roses
one day and lilies-of-the-valley the next. Bother those
roses!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wondered if Miss Gilbert would ride with him
again. He hoped so. But the next time, if there was
one, should be fully as much her doing as his. That
was only fair to her. Sên King-lo had neither wish nor
willingness to push any woman’s inclination—not even
Miss Julia’s, whose proved warm friendship gave him
some license—least of all that of a girl who had no
great liking for him or his company. But he wondered
if she would pave the way for him to ask if they might
go again. He hoped so. And a very slight and delicate
pavement would do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strolled back from the window, and sat up till
nearly daylight puzzling over a game of chess he was
playing with a friend in Siangtan. But first he copied
the date on his cuff into a notebook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kow Li did not go to Massachusetts Avenue the next
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More ciphered cables come to Washington than those
that are sent from Downing Street and Whitehall or
Threadneedle and Lombard Streets. A disquieting cable
came from Pekin to Sên King-lo as he breakfasted, and
he forgot all about Miss Gilbert’s confession-book.</p>

<h1 id='t4449'>CHAPTER XIV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>From East and from West the sea-covered wires
ran with alarm and twanged with suspense for
a week or more. Something like international crises
threatened, and quivered the diplomatic air. Officials
were suspiciously polite to those of other countries, and
spoke to those of their own in crisp, bothered sentences.
And the press in a dozen countries girded its loins,
strained its ears, sharpened its imaginations, and looked
carefully to its ink-wells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the small “affair” passed—as happily sometimes
it does—and Washington shook itself good-humoredly as
after some spring drizzle that had had more notice than
it deserved, but had done no particular harm; and got
back to play—cotillions, tennis and moonlit river picnics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Sên found time to call on Lady Snow, and found
her alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was glad to see him, and said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am fortunate to find you at home this tempting
day,” he returned. “You are quite well again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly, thanks. It was nice of you to send twice
to ask. You are about the only man who has troubled
whether we were dead or alive—my ankle and me—these
last ten days. I’ve scarcely seen a soul; and Sir Charles
has about lived at the silly old Embassy—and not heard
what I’ve said half the time when he has been here. And
I suppose you have too; it was nice of you to think to
send to ask after the kiddies and me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I could not forget to do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t you? Several—that we’ve known longer
than we have you—could. You’ve been desperately busy
and excited, of course?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a very small fish in the international sea—calm
or troubled,” her guest insisted. “I wonder if
you will let me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, no!” his hostess cried, dramatically, her
hands over her ears. “I know that you and Japan,
and poor little Korea—you ought to be well ashamed
of yourselves, both of you, for the way you’ve played
battledore and shuttlecock with Korea—have been hoping
to cut each other’s throats—but you cut lower
down than throats, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On occasions,” Sên admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him no time to say more, but caught her
breath up where it had failed her—“and Germany planning
to murder us all in our beds again, and Switzerland
having the army photographed——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miniatured, I should think,” he interjected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—and all the rest of it. But I decline to hear any
details. I hate the lot of you. Why can’t you sit still,
and be good, this terrifically hot weather? I’m desperately
tired of State secrets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A white line gleamed between Sên’s lips. He had
no intention of pressing Legation or Consulate secrets
on Lady Snow, and he did not believe that Sir Charles
surfeited her with State secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should not have presumed to make that appalling
blunder,” he said. “I was going to say that I wondered
if you would let me see your children, Lady Snow.
May I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw the flippancy fall from her face as snow fades
in a sudden deluge of sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would like to see Dick and Blanche? Truly? I
like you, Mr. Sên. Of course, you shall see them! And
the dear little monkeys are worth seeing and knowing.
I’m very proud of my babies; and I’ve a right to be.
But not today. They’re gone to Rosehill with my cousin.
Charlie’s at the Embassy, of course. He half promised
to get home for tea—but he won’t! Just look at that
clock. Do ring! We’ll have ours now. Dawson ought
to have brought it ages ago. But probably I told them
not to, until I rang—Sir Charles said he might come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo lingered a courteous length of time, after
his second cup of tea. He took sugar and cream in it
here. Lady Snow paid nearly two dollars a pound for
her tea, but Sên King-lo thought that all such tea needed
all the sugar and cream it could get.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles did not come. Sên left a greeting for him,
reminded Lady Snow of his wish to meet her children,
repeated his pleasure at having seen her again, and
went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not go home, or to his club. He crossed the
Potomac. He had not seen Miss Townsend for several
days; and not only she allowed him to call at any odd
hour; but he knew that she liked him to do that. So,
late as it was, and far afield, he went from Massachusetts
Avenue to Rosehill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sar,” Uncle Lysander told him, his mistress
was at home and certain sure he could go in—Lysander
knew his standing orders, and knew better than to
disobey them. But Dr. Elenore Ray caught a sultry
tone in the old black’s voice as he announced at the
open drawing-room door that “Mr. Swing”—an impertinence
of mispronunciation in which he indulged himself
now and then—“has done come to see you, Miss
Julia, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you lost your watch, or come to supper?”
Miss Julia demanded bitingly. But her bright old eyes
welled with welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both!” Sên instantly lied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I shall have to give you your supper, then,”
she complained—Miss Julia was in highest good humor.
“I’m not sorry to see you,” she added. “I want you to
know Dr. Elenore Prescott Ray. Elenore, may I present
my friend, Mr. Sên King-lo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Sên, having bowed, looked down at the face
of the woman seated near Miss Townsend—a wonderful
face, he thought; the finest, sweetest, and strongest face
he ever had seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have been having a delightful afternoon, Mr.
Sên,” Dr. Ray told him. “A children’s party. It has
just gone home. I wasn’t invited. It was in full swing
when I chanced to call. You have only just missed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The telephone bell rang in the hall, and Miss Julia
rose and left them. She was not in the telephone book.
She looked coldly on telephones, as on a number of other
and even more modern inventions, but she found hers
useful in speaking to Washington tradesmen; and
usually she answered and used it herself—Uncle Lysander
was sickly afeared of the ’phone, and Dinah,
her next most trusted servant, at the ’phone could do
nothing but giggle into the receiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her other guest turned to Sên with a pleasant smile
that lit up her face, almost without moving it—chiefly
a smile in her fine clear eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have known Miss Townsend since we were very
small girls, but I saw a new side of my old friend today.
It was very charming to hear her telling stories to the
mites who were here. She did it delightfully. I can’t
tell you how they loved it. And how she loved doing
it! It was touching.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very,” said Sên gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elenore Ray gave him a scanning look, and, at something
she read there, he had made her his friend. But
she only said quietly—for she, too, was a sash-wearer—“They
were nice children—the tots that were here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Very</span> nice children,” Miss Julia emphasized, catching
the last words as she came—it had been a wrong-number
call—“they do their mother and their governess
great credit. Well-behaved children are a true refreshment
in these mad days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I,” the physician laughed, “find naughty children
a tonic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not,” Miss Julia said sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do!” her friend repeated. “And I make more
money out of them. You see, I am an avaricious doctor,
Mr. Sên.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên laughed. “Was it a large party, Madame?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quality and not quantity,” Miss Julia answered. “I
wish you had come earlier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I had,” Sên King-lo replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have made us the even half-dozen. We were
an odd number—five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why count me?” Dr. Ray asked. “I was but a
looker-on in Venice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only two children—but such nice little things,”
Miss Julia told Sên. “The Snows’ boy and girl. Their
cousin brought them to spend the day with me. You
remember her, don’t you? Miss Gilbert? She stayed the
night of the garden party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I remember Miss Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you like her?” Miss Townsend demanded
abruptly. She had caught the reserve in his tone;
so had Dr. Ray and had interpreted it differently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I say so?” he asked gaily. “But I do like
Miss Gilbert—very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hostess looked at him a little regretfully. She
liked those she liked to like each other—and she had
mistrusted his tone. But Dr. Ray threw him a shrewder
glance. She, too, mistrusted his tone, and her mistrust
took a different trend. Able in all her craft,
diagnosis was her forte. She rarely erred in it. It
was a great physician, the slender patrician that almost
lounged, so assured and easy her sitting, in Miss
Townsend’s great-grandfather’s favorite chair, a long
history of sorrow and service carved on the face in
which time and life had cut many, but only beautiful
lines. Soft waves of snow covered a graceful, queenly-held
head, and the long, thin hands, lying loosely on the
great chair’s big arm-knobs, were as masterful as they
were lovely—the polished finger-nails as rosy and
mooned as a girl’s. She was a great physician, adding
distinction to the profession it had cost her a hard,
bitter fight—and sometimes a tortured one—to enter.
But the physician armed with a genius for absolute
diagnosis should not find professional greatness too far
or too difficult a cry. She gave Sên King-lo a long steady
look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know the Snows, do you?” Miss Julia
asked him—more to retreat from a <span class='it'>cul-de-sac</span> she felt
a trifle rasped than because she cared to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Madame, I do—Sir Charles and his wife. I
have not had the pleasure of meeting the small ones yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—yes—I suppose you diplomatic-staff people all
know each other, more or less, whether you care to or
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are apt to meet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I daresay you know every one in Washington
now,” Julia remarked, rather purringly. She was proud
of the place her once cold-shouldered protége had gained
in the capital’s society that she herself rather scorned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know a good many.” And this time Dr. Ray
thought that there was nothing forced in the indifference
of his tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like <span class='it'>them</span>—the Snows?” Miss Julia questioned
again. It was her habit, and Sên’s delight, that
she always questioned him as she liked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much,” he told her cordially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like him,” Miss Townsend said, with no uncertain
emphasis on the pronoun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo sprang to the defense of an absent woman
on whose face he but now had seen maternity’s beautiful
blazon. “I like Lady Snow, Madame,” he remarked. “I
am sure there is a great deal more in her than the <span class='it'>chic</span>
prettiness that one sees and the gay banter one hears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you?” From any one else the slight but patrician
sniff would have sounded a rudeness. “I,” she continued,
“<span class='it'>know</span> that there is very much more in Ivy
Gilbert than shows on the surface. I am very fond of
Ivy. I wish she had a gayer time. Girls should be gay.
You liked Ivy, Elenore, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I liked her,” the other said promptly. “And I
like her face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like all of her,” loyal Miss Julia insisted. “I shall
ask the children here again. You must come, too, Mr.
Sên.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gladly. I asked Lady Snow today to let me see them.
But, of course, she could not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because they were here. And that is why you came
so late—when you knew they’d be gone! You must be
anxious to meet them! So—you know Lady Snow well
enough to call!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was not sure they would be gone, Madame,” Sên
said a little lamely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph!” Miss Julia commented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Ray smiled at the carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish—yes, Lysander, we are coming,” for Lysander
was bowing and grinning in the doorway, “I wish Ivy
had a gayer time,” Miss Julia repeated as she led the
way to the dining-room. “Every girl has a right to
have a good time. As nice a girl as Ivy Gilbert has a
right to a great deal of fun and gay good times. They
need it,” she sighed softly, and Sên thought she looked
sadly across her garden as they passed the hall’s wide
windows. Her own girlhood had been defrauded of its
gaiety-right—robbed by war’s seared and shriveled
aftermath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No pleasanter meal-time passed in Washington that
night than passed at Miss Julia’s supper-table. The odd
trio proved as congenial as it was odd. Of the two
Southern women, one since babyhood had passed all
her life here and a stone’s throw from here, and had lived
all of it as her foremothers had lived in the old regnant
Virginia days. The other was traveled, experienced,
steeped in life’s up-and-downs, scarred and made taut
by its jolts, chiseled fine by its jars, broadened and perfumed
by the sacrifices it had called upon her for, and
by the unfailing dignity and soul-loyalty, the supreme
personal courage with which she never failed to make the
sacrificial payment. Both the women wore time’s diadem
of soft snow above their clear, clean foreheads, and God’s
love in their hearts, God’s fellowship in their souls—one
with the mind of a man and the heart of a woman,
a woman of the world, chastened and puissant, a creature
of dignity and of enormous force and charm; the other
changed in little—in little that counts—from her earliest
girlhood, a child still in much, as full of prejudice as she
was of goodness and sweetness. Both caught now the slow
music his scythe made as the Reaper garnered the human
grain down by the cold, dark river. The man—an alien
Chinese, far from the home he loved, was at ease here,
as everywhere, but never at home, never to be at home
save in the home of the wild white rose—still in his
youth, ginger hot in his mouth, the cup as yet but just
to his lip, his fight to come, his spurs to win, his soul
girded but still very young, vowed to a cause some
thought already lost—well, they too had seen their cause
lost, their flag torn—never soiled—in defeat. He was
seeking and striving for victory’s crown; one of them
knew—for she had won and wore it—that defeat has the
greater crown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Ray was much interested to meet Sên King-lo, and
to see and consider him in this easy, intimate way. She
had known many Chinese—but not before a Chinese
gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost greedy still, in her splendid, beautiful ageing,
for new experiences, more and still more knowledge, she
welcomed this experience and made her most of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Elenore Ray liked Sên King-lo. She liked his
simplicity; a woman, she more than liked his deference;
she liked his pleasant dignity, his unaffected repose, his
good-humored reserve, and her quick, brilliant mind
caught and rejoiced at the brilliance and quickness of
his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked more than they ate, at the well-spread
and tempting table—they talked long and late on the
porch afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once Sên consulted the watch he had claimed to have
lost, and turned to Dr. Ray and mentioned the hour.
“May I serve you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not by seeing her home,” Julia answered. “She’s
staying the night. I don’t see her so often that I let her
go soon when she does come. And you need not go yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when she thought it was time for Sên King-lo to
go, she said so; and he went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very interesting man,” was Dr. Ray’s comment,
as they heard the front door close. “I am very glad to
have met him.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Sên King-lo called today,” Lady Snow told her husband
at dinner that night. “He left regards and all
that for you, Charlie, and he was perfectly sweet about
the children. I think he came specially to see them—and
he’s coming again. He was so disappointed that they
were out. But, Ivy, he did not ask after you. I thought
it so odd. Did you treat him badly the other day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you rode together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—then! No, I don’t suppose I did. For I had an
exceptionally pleasant time, and I mean him to take me
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which, in my opinion, he will not, if you snub him,”
Emma said sagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” Ivy laughed, “I sha’n’t trouble to do that
again. It isn’t worth it, and he rides too well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He does most things well,” Sir Charles observed.</p>

<h1 id='t4865'>CHAPTER XV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>The next day but one Sên sent back Miss Gilbert’s
“confession-book,” and with it a boxful of lilies-of-the-valley.
He sent no message, no note, not even a
card. But the flowers and the book were under one
cord-tied cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came in the early morning, and Ivy wondered
what florist’s he’d found open so early—until she glanced
at her clock, and saw that it lacked little of ten. She
had danced until three, and had breakfasted in bed—the
children being excused from “school” today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heaped the lilies out on the coverlid beside her,
and opened the book. How queer the Chinese writing
looked! Heathenish—but picturesque—beautiful, even,
she finally decided. Then she turned the leaf and read
and reread the English translation. One question that
he had answered in Chinese, he had left unanswered in
English: “What is your favorite woman’s name?”
But, of course, his favorite woman’s name was a Chinese
name—and could not be translated into English. She
turned back and studied the Chinese character. It was
exquisitely made, she thought—almost as if the man’s
hand and his brush had lingered tenderly over it. Was
it a sweetheart’s name? No—it couldn’t be, for he never
had so much as seen a Chinese girl—he’d said so that
first night at Miss Julia’s—and it had stuck in her
memory because it had struck her Western mind as at
once the most absurd and the most preposterous thing
she had ever heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wondered what this name he most liked sounded
like. She’d ask Charles to read it aloud to her. Probably
Charlie didn’t pronounce Chinese with impeccable
Chinese accent, but she knew that he spoke that language—or
had spoken it some years ago—and no doubt he
could read it a little. She’d like to hear how that funny
looking little name sounded. It must be a short name—with
just one character—that was what they called them,
she thought—in its writing: a chubby little name, if its
“character” at all depicted it—but neither unpretty nor
ungraceful, for delicate curves—almost hair-lines one or
two—crossed and jutted out daintily from its fat thicker
sweeps of the brush. How unlike English writing this
Chinese writing was! Strange that inked makeshifts
for spoken words, so unlike as these that Mr. Sên had
written in Chinese and those he’d written in English
were, could stand for the same things, convey the same
meanings! But did they? Were Chinese thoughts and
English—hearts, minds, emotions—in anyway one? The
man she had ridden with the other day had seemed so
little un-English to her! And he had found her a little
Chinese—that first night at Miss Julia’s. Could hands
of the West and hands of the East meet now and then,
after all, in grip not altogether Eurasian and flabby?
How interesting it all was! And she’d never given it a
thought before! How full of wonderful things the world
was—and life!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stretched comfortably up on her pillows, and
gathered a mass of the exquisite flowers up to her face.
Her soft hair lay loose about her, clouding the cambric
and torchon of her pretty nightgown, perfuming her
hair and her dimpled chin. Like all women who care
for clothes in the nicest way, care for the sense of soft
fabric on soft skin, for the beauty of texture and tint and
line, for the clothes for the sake of the reflection they
give of a personal daintiness and taste, and not for
what they “show,” Ivy, obliged to skimp, skimped on
outer garments that others saw, rather than on those that
only she and her mirror ever saw, those that touched her
intimately. Being young and raw she often was ashamed
of coat and skirt, or of dance frock less fresh and good
than were those of other girls, but she would have felt a
grosser shame to put coarse, roughly-trimmed calico
against her skin, which being sensible and not blind,
she knew deserved its first sheath of covering to be as
nearly delicate as loom and needle could contrive. It
was a very pretty nightgown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bedclothes were both costly and beautiful. Emma
Snow was house-proud. And she was too nice a woman,
and too proud in the best sense, to house her husband’s
girl cousin less well than she did herself. This—the
girl’s own room—less crowded than Emma’s luxurious
own, was not less well furnished or carefully appointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a pretty picture—the room and the girl in the
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She yawned happily and cuddled her lilies against her
face. One spray slipped from her hand, and lay inside
the lace of her gown. The morning sun came in rose
through the window. And the rose in the girl’s brunette
face answered it, coming and going at her musing
thoughts, with the trick of rose ebb and flow that was so
constant on her face, and was half its charm—rarely a
blush, but always a beauty. Her soft, dark hair, all
perfumed by the lilies’ sweetness, rippled over her pillows,
and shadowed her throat. One hand nursed lilies-of-the-valley,
and so did her cheek—one hand lay on the
open confession-book, her filbert nails lying pink on a
page of Chinese characters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Gilbert was a very pretty girl—more than pretty—face
and body had considerable loveliness, but her
hands were her paramount beauty, as hands always are,
in every race, in the woman whose loveliness is Nature’s
deliberate achievement, and not just happily accidental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did lilies-of-the-valley grow too in China—the flowers
she loved most? And their perfume was always an
intoxicant to her. Did they grow in China? She’d ask
Charles—or Mr. Sên. Mr. Sên who had not asked after
her the day before yesterday. Why should he? How
silly Emma was! “King-lo”—what a “given” name!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lo,” she said aloud—not very loud—and giggled
softly at the sound, so much less like a man’s given name
than “Tom” or “Roger” or “Rupert.” “Lo!” And
yet—and yet—what about “Llewellyn” and “Silas”
and “Jonas”? She knew a charming man here in
Washington whose name was “Silas.” She rather
thought that she’d prefer to call her brother—if she had
one—“Lo” to calling him “Silas” or “Llewellyn” or
“Jonas.” And “Heinrich”! Yes—she certainly’d
rather own to a brother “Lo” than to a brother “Heinrich.”
“Sên”—“Sên” wasn’t so bad, really it wasn’t.
She thought it a far nicer name than “Watkins” or
“Snider” or “Green” or “Pink” or “Higginbotham.”
“Lo.” “Jo.” “Jo”—she was rather fond of “Jo”—much
as she disliked “Joseph.” There were quite a
lot of English names she disliked. There was not much
difference between “Lo” and “Jo”—very little difference
indeed. “Jo” was the nicer, of course—it sounded
more masculine, and it looked so. But—after all——</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew the book nearer, and turned a page. How
well this new Chinese acquaintance—whom Charlie liked
so much—wrote English. <span class='it'>And</span> you could read it! It
was a “’varsity hand”—but perfectly legible, which so
many ’varsity handwritings were not. It had all their
hall-marks—the Greek <span class='it'>e’s</span>, the quickness and smallness,
the nice absence of flourish. But it had individuality,
and such courteous clearness! How English it was! It
seemed almost impossible that the man who wrote it was
not English. She turned back a page, and looked hard
and long at the Chinese signature—giggling again at the
ridiculousness it looked to her. Charlie said her giggle
was like a Chinese girl’s! Well—what if it was? Probably
many Chinese girls were very nice—and were
charming. She liked Mr. Sên. The girls here in Washington
were silly about him—and odious. But she liked
him in a sensible, straightforward way—as a sensible,
straightforward, and very interesting acquaintance. It
seemed funny for a man to have such small and delicate
hands, but when he had swung her up to her saddle she
had felt his hand rock-sure and steel-strong under her
foot and her weight. How beautiful her lilies were—and
how sweet!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl and her flowers made a pretty picture, as she
lounged there—even Chinese eyes must have thought so,
could they have seen her all rumpled, but dainty, as she
lay there in her bed, thinking thoughts she little knew,
one hand holding the sweet flowers to her face—the blue
eiderdown heaped with them and their long green leaves—one
hand resting on a Chinese confession.</p>

<h1 id='t5040'>CHAPTER XVI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>From then they were thrown together almost constantly—not
by others, but by circumstances and
social accidents. And both to her surprise and to his—more
to his than to hers—their acquaintance rapidly
grew into friendship. It was nothing freakish, it was
comradeship direct and unsilly. They met often, and
knew that they liked each other, and liked to be together.
They soon knew that they liked each other, but had no
realization of how much. Sên King-lo suspected it first.
Their divergences were a zest. And they had much in
common, and that made between them a bond. Each was
lonely—Ivy sometimes, King-lo almost always. Each
was an alien, apart in an alien place. Each was at once
homesick and homeless. Each found refreshment and
tonic in the other. There were English traits and
Chinese surprises in Sên, and personality that attracted
her strongly. They had a score of English experiences
in common. They were a boon to the homesick girl. The
girl was virginal, and that attracted greatly the man of
a people who cherish and reverence only one quality—maternity—more
intensely than they do virginity. He
knew that her friendliness had in it nothing mawkish.
And in the wholesomeness of their friendship, and the
wholesomeness and manliness of the man, Ivy quite
forgot her first cheap desire to pique the girls who “ran
after” him not too nicely. She was glad that Charles
and Miss Julia valued Sên so highly, and she gave no
more care or thought to what any one else thought or
said of her new camaraderie. Not greatly educated, the
English girl was beautifully intelligent: that attracted
Sên King-lo even more than it at first surprised him.
They liked and disliked many of the same things. They
shared many prejudices. He was grateful to her for
being beautiful, and for a hint of his own race now and
then in eyes, gesture and voice. She was grateful to him
for being always deferential, and often amusing, always
companionable and interesting, and for his dependability
to know whether Eton or Harrow had won at Lords,
whether Surrey or Middlesex was at the top of the cricket
average, and all about every stroke Oxford and Cambridge
had made from Putney start to Mortlake finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl found the keener interest, the man stumbled
into the stronger liking. But while she found no fault
in him, he found a terrible fault in her, and it rankled
his quickening and strengthening liking sorely; her indifference
to all children, even to her own little cousins.
The opal owes its loveliness and its lure to its flaw. The
Chinese soul of Sên King-lo could see nothing but deformity
and disease in the slightest flaw that even specked
a girl’s womanliness. It grieved him that a girl who,
he knew, attracted him more each time they met did not
care for little children. He held it an enormity; it
rankled and it bit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside another month, all Washington—the “four
hundred”—knew that Mr. Sên and Miss Gilbert had
become—to put it nicely—“great friends.” A few were
disgusted, most were amused, and not a few were jealous:
Reginald Hamilton and a few dozen women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all the antipathetical bewildering psychology of
East and West there is nothing more baffling than the
lure of European women to Asiatic men. Know the East
longest, search it most tirelessly, grow most in sympathy
with it, and still you can see but darkly and not far into
that inter-racial puzzle and secret of human nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The average and the typical men of the Orient are
excellent husbands—polygamous?—granted. But what
of their women? The “rights” the men denied their
wives for centuries of centuries those wives would have
resented as insult, spurned as outrage and burden. It is
not facile to enfranchise a race, a caste or a sex that
will have none of it. Even in Earth’s “freest” country
you may coax, or lead or prod a woman to the polling-booth,
but you can’t make her vote. Not yet. And in
this new day of our greatest enlightenments when enfranchisement
is peeping seductively over the shoulders of
Oriental women, it is those women who hang back and
hesitate, not their husbands and masters who hold them
back or coerce them. The Oriental husband is not a
tyrant. His wives rule and coerce him oftener than he
does one of them. He locks them up in some places, and
in some castes. They’d berate and punish him if he
did not. The most ruthless ruler Afghanistan ever has
had could not control or direct his favorite wife. She
over-sat, she over-ate, and she over-smoked very badly
indeed. Her physicians protested and warned. The
Amir was thoroughly frightened, greatly distressed. He
cajoled, he pleaded, he bribed with the moving bribery of
pearls and jeweled tissues and thick perfumes, and it
is reported that at least twice he wept. But the result
was nothing. His wife laughed and pouted and scoffed
and defied and calmly and obstinately lolled, ate sweetmeats,
and smoked herself to obesity and death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chinese man who launders undergarments and
table linen or barters <span class='it'>chop suey</span> in Chicago or St. Louis,
living in a dearth of Chinese women, marries an American
wife and makes her an admirable and a generous
husband. The Chinese merchant in the Straits Settlements
chooses a wife from any one of a score of non-Chinese
races, and they jog on together most comfortably,
and he lets her rule such of their life and hours as are
mutual far more than he, although in intelligence,
education and principles she is his inferior, and he knows
it. Chinese men of education, of some natural taste and
refinement, and with ideals and sterling personal worth
sometimes “take in washing” for a profession, but
American women of commensurate qualities do not marry
them. The Eastern man is proud of his woman, admires
her and is satisfied with her and her ways. He guards
and he pampers her more often than not—unless he’s a
Japanese—the Parsi, the Sikh, the Chinese, the Burmese
(<span class='it'>he has</span> to), the Cingalese, the Hindoo, yes, and the
strict Mohammedan too! And every Eastern man
regards the “white” races as inferior to his own, is
convinced that they are, and looks down upon them.
He does not find Westerners companionable, he does not
find them handsome or beautiful. He dislikes their
customs, abhors their dress, and despises their creeds.
And he loathes their food. Why, then, the desire of the
Oriental for a European (and the blonder the better)
mistress or wife? It seems inexplicable. But it <span class='it'>is</span>. The
fact remains. More than one ruler of an “independent”
Indian State has married a European of rougher birth,
less education, more inferior mind, uncouther manners
than his own, and imperiled his throne and succession,
even his life in doing it—and knowing that he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the attraction that Sên King-lo felt in this
English girl there was no abnormality—unless the
friendly touch of yellow and white hands is in itself
abnormality. He had been educated in her country and
in its ways. In much he <span class='it'>was</span> English. He not only could
read, write and speak her language, but he could think
in it—and often did. He had read more English books
than she had, knew more English facts than she did—and
knew far more of the deeds, the years, and the
thought that have made England. And between the
typical English and the typical Chinese the difference is
surprisingly small—and is mostly superficial: a matter
of skin-tints and of bone-formation. There <span class='it'>is</span> a spiritual
difference—we in England have not learned to repose on
Nature, to merge in her as the Chinese do, and we reverence
ancestry and old age less, guard childhood less
loyally, less tenderly. But England grows—as America
does—in all this. And if the race of Shakespeare and
Shelley and Newman lives up less to its ideals, grasps
them less and less generally than does the race of Han,
the ideals of the two—at best—are the same. We—Anglo-Saxons
and Celts—have less vision than the
Chinese and its interknit and absorbed races have, but a
gleam glows in the sky of the Occident—it peeps through
the blanket of our dark. We are less insular than we
were—some of us at least. The Oriental lectures—than
which nothing in London is more worth having—at the
School of Oriental Studies in Finsbury Circus are
sparsely attended, but some of us do go, and come away
grateful. The East always will be East—in spite of
intermittent, ape-like freaks. Probably the crasser West
always will be West. But the two may meet yet, concordant
parts of one splendid whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attraction of the Western woman for the Eastern
man <span class='it'>in the West</span> is a simpler and a more normal thing
than her attraction of him in the East. Debarred from
the womanhood of his own race in London or New York,
because there are no such women there, an Oriental’s
leaning towards an East-and-West marriage or intimacy
has something of the humdrum quality of poor Hobson’s
narrowed choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo never had seen a Chinese girl!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Gilbert’s attraction of Sên first and last was a
matter of personality and of person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably its next strength was a matter of caste. She
seemed to him wholly and charmingly patrician. Sên
King-lo—as many young Chinese have done ever since
Wang-Ah Shih made an Empire and an Emperor
ridiculous—believed himself to be “republican”; but he
was not. He could not be. He saw in Ivy Gilbert the
caste of his mothers—the ancestral women he worshiped.
He saw in Ivy—a slip of English girlhood—the imperial
feminine of a great, puissant, imperial people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Republic, commonwealth, kingdom, democracy, empire—take
your choice. There are things to be said of them
all—they all have their points. You may not be able
to choose an empire, if you’re too long about it—so they
say—well, we shall see, or our children’s children will.
Prophecy’s a thankless, perilous pastime. And even the
writing on the wall blunders sometimes. But this much
is true; our old shifting Earth has but two empires left
her now—China’s and England’s. Japan doesn’t count—yet.
It mixes and meddles, but in the ultimate soul
bigness <span class='it'>it does not count</span>. And China’s a republic you
say? China is not—never has been and never can be,
except in the fevered dreaming of a day of midsummer
madness, the demented throes of a short nightmare;
there are intrinsic qualities of peoples as of individual
characters which no label can change. Under another
name China may not be so comfortable a place to live in,
but it is an empire still, disfigured, demented, but neither
shattered nor lost—but not less than empire while the
soul of the Sages, whom she wombed and who too begat
her, breathes through the soul of her people, the poppies
and bamboos hang at the edge of the Yellow Sorrow, and
the silkworms gorge on the mulberry leaves and empurple
the looms. And while those twin empires stand—in so
much alike, so much unalike—a something will show in
many faces of two races’ women which shows in no
others. It is not distinction—though it often includes
it; it is not courage—though it never lacks it; it is not
flare or flame; it is not beauty; though never unfeminine
it is not femininity; it is not dignity, though it never is
cheap, it never asserts itself—it has no need to; it is not
self-conscious; it is neither humble nor proud and yet
it is both; it is neither virtue nor individuality; still
less is it cant; it is empire—racial empire and personal
empire: a part and a whole. A thing to admire? That’s
as you think. But while the wild white rose perfumes
the graves of Li’s ancestors, and the Augean goats browse
by the graves of English boys in Gallipoli, that something
will show in the faces of one type—the best type—of
Chinese and English women. Ts’z-hi had it, and Ivy
Gilbert, whatever medley her ancestry, undeniably had
it, and the eyes of a Chinese man, who had been a sash-wearer
for thousands of years, saw it and gloated. She
wore it here in Washington; in the nursery schoolroom,
in the ballroom or at Rosehill, as Ts’z-hi had worn it in
the Vermilion Palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Sên King-lo was attracted by Ivy Gilbert was not
odd. That he attracted her, would be longer to explain,
if one could—more intricate and difficult to trace. But
he did. And her liking and friendliness turned to him
in the good old hackneyed way that sunflowers have
turned to the sun ever since Adam made the meanest
and truest excuse in human history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tempted him—though he didn’t know it yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Youth called to youth. Loneliness answered to loneliness.
Sex called to sex.</p>

<h1 id='t5295'>CHAPTER XVII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Emma Snow took alarm first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want Ivy to marry Sên King-lo?” she
suddenly asked her husband one morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn! Hell!” the phlegmatic Englishman cried
hotly. He was shaving, and he’d cut himself rather
badly. (He had a dressing-room of his own, and used
it but rarely.) He sopped off the blood as well as he
could, then flung about on his wife more angry and ruder
than she ever had seen him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be disgusting!” he snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see what I see,” she retorted smoothly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I decline to listen to preposterous, lying, nauseating
vulgarity,” Snow growled, his mouth twitching angrily.
“Such a hideous idea never entered, or could, any head
but yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see what I see,” she repeated good-humoredly. She
was sorry for Charlie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blow what you see!” Rage, and perhaps a subconscious
sick fear, obsessed him, made him forget himself
in their torturing grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Use your eyes!” his wife advised him more coldly.
And, not unjustly incensed, she finished her own toilet in
silence, and went down to the breakfast-room without a
glance or a word more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Ray saw it next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician was still in Washington. Independent
now of her large Chicago practice, she took more and
more time each year for the travel and study she loved;
and few years passed in which she did not make at least
one stay of weeks, if not months, in Washington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want pretty Miss Gilbert to marry Sên King-lo?”
she asked Miss Julia as they sat one morning at
breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia was furious. Her old hands trembled so
that she dropped the cup she was lifting. It had been
in the Townsends’ possession only goodness and the gods
of the South knew how long; and she didn’t give it a
look as it crashed in fragments on the floor, nor a glance
to the pools of hot coffee staining the breakfast damask
and her crisp morning-gown. She didn’t say “Damn,”
and she didn’t say “Hell”; but for all that, she answered
her friend very much as Sir Charles Snow had answered
his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician took it in perfect good part. But she
stood her ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help thinking that this is just what it is shaping
towards, Julia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are horrible,” Miss Townsend moaned sickly.
“It couldn’t be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” Dr. Ray demanded gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia Townsend shrank back in her chair—speechless.
She could not have been more surprised, dismayed,
disappointed if Jefferson Davis had proved a traitor or
Robert E. Lee disgraced his uniform—not half so much
so if Mexico’s gulf had submerged her beloved South.
She felt soiled by the tongue of a friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” Dr. Ray insinuated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not! Because the bare suggestion is abominable,”
Miss Julia exclaimed. “I’d <span class='it'>kill</span> Sên King-lo if
I believed that he even could harbor the vile thought—which
I know he could not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not believe that he has thought of it yet,” Dr.
Ray said, helping herself to the omelette Miss Julia made
no motion to offer. “I am sure they have not thought of
it yet—either of them. People usually marry first, and
think after, I’ve noticed. And I believe they will do it—marry
each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia, with a thin old hand that shook violently
under its burden of gems, pushed a silver dish of fast-cooling
sweetbreads farther afield, as if she feared the
other might take food she’d grudge her. She did it
automatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They might do worse—perhaps,” the guest said
musingly. “But I know you wouldn’t like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God!” Julia Townsend moaned. “And you—you
a Southern woman! A <span class='it'>Southern</span> woman—and my
friend! You used to be my friend!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not like it either,” Dr. Ray said quietly—too
true a physician to be incensed at nerves. “But, Julia,
the world moves. We can’t shut our eyes to that. At
least, I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Miss Julia shuddered, a green shadow lay on her
trembling mouth. She was nauseated, soul and body.
But the physician went on, “cruel to be kind,” as such
physicians do:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know a very nice girl in Chicago who has married
a Chinaman—several years ago it was. They are perfectly
happy. He is kind and generous to her. He has
a sort of delicatessen shop and curio shop mixed—food
on one side, dishes and vases and Joss-sticks and Jacob’s-ladders
on the other. He works from dawn to dusk, and
must be worth a good deal by this—but he never lets
her do a hand’s turn, and her silks and furs and rings—good
rings—are a scandal. And their baby——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” Miss Julia ordered in a terrible voice. Her
eyes were ablaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they both are peasants—at least she certainly
is—and I often have wondered how such a marriage
would result between husband and wife, both of gentle
birth. It would be very interesting——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Julia Townsend could bear no more. She covered
her face in her coffee-sodden napkin and broke into sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elenore Ray shook her head sadly. If Julia took the
uncorroborated hint like this, how would she take the
accomplished fact—if it eventuated?</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Emma Snow had warned Sir Charles; Dr. Ray had
warned Miss Julia. Except that each had angered and
disgusted, neither had made the slightest impression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo came and went at the Massachusetts Avenue
house and at Rosehill as before, and both Snow and
Miss Julia scorned to notice how, or how often, he and
Ivy spoke to each other. Dr. Ray held her peace and
so did Lady Snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that was more than Washington did. Would it
be a match? Men made bets at the clubs, and women
“Oh”-ed and “Ah”-ed and “My dear”-ed over tea-cups
and cocktails—in Turkish Baths, and even in whispers
at church. Had Sên King-lo been caught at last? Was
he going to marry Ivy Gilbert? What did the Chinese
Minister think about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, the Chinese Minister did not state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Washington is a gossipy place—it gossips in many
languages, and from several angles. There is even more
talk in Washington than there is in Simla. But Washington
rarely had a more diverting theme than this.
“Ivy Gilbert and Sên King-lo” were on every tongue.
But, oddly enough, not a word of it had reached either.
No thought of marriage, not even of “love,” had occurred
most remotely to the Chinese man or to the English girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she wore his perfumed lily-bells now—and they
came more and more often. And Emma Snow knew
what the florist himself could have told her, if she had
not, that to no other woman, not even to Miss Julia, did
Sên King-lo ever send lilies-of-the-valley. And the florist
could have confirmed Lady Snow’s belief that to no other
girl did Sên King-lo ever send a flower. But the florist
kept lips as close as the Chinese Minister’s own. But
while others guessed and wondered, the florist had not
the slightest doubt of how it would end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The friendship begun by a common aversion to kissing,
a jade-green frock, and a bunch of dangling crimson
peppers grew—and more than once it pulsed.</p>

<h1 id='t5483'>CHAPTER XVIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline Hamilton lay on a pile of cushions
heaped on the floor, one hand under her head, her
knees hunched up in what she thought a Chinese attitude,
a cigarette she tried to imagine was opium in her mouth,
a purple kimono, embroidered with blue chrysanthemums
and red and gold dragons and beetles and smaller bugs,
flopped loosely about her. She flattered the garment
that it was ultra-Chinese, but it was merely an atrocious
libel on the women of Japan. It revealed an appalling
stretch of her amazingly thin legs and not only all her
neck, but much that lies below necks. But that was less
exposure than it sounds—for Emmeline was built as
chastely flat as her mother: except for her nose and ears
there scarcely was a jut on Emmeline. She caved in here
and there thinly, but she nowhere bulged. A Chinese
woman, even one whose profession was frailty, would
sooner have strangled or starved herself or have perished
by slow suffering inches than have exposed any part of
her neck. But Emmeline didn’t know that. Her
mawkish but intense and tigerish infatuation for Sên
King-lo was no greater than her ignorance of his people
and their customs. Her furniture, which had cost enough
to be good, was a poor imitation of inlaid teak-wood. The
room was thick and sneeze-provoking with the smoke of
joss-sticks that by chance <span class='it'>were</span> Chinese, which the prints
and <span class='it'>kakemonos</span> on the walls were not, but the prints
were good of their sort, and the costumes they showed
were the garb of an older China—for Japan took her
dress, as she’s taken most she has that is best—from
China centuries ago. The great gong that stood conspicuously
and inconveniently in the middle of the
room hailed from the Tottenham Court Road and had
been made not far from that street of “Horse-Shoe” and
furniture for cash or time-payment. A porcelain bowl
of sweet-meats lay on the floor beside her, a pair of
chop-sticks she simply could not learn to manipulate
crossed above the chocolates and glacé fruits. She wore
an oleander flower over one ear and a tiny orange-colored
fan over the other. She was well hung with
jade—such as it was—and the foot from which she had
kicked its heelless sandal showed that she wore white
stockings made like mittens, with separate compartments
provided for flat great toes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had taken her flat for a year; and had furnished
it, as she believed (and said), in an absolutely Chinese
way. And she lived here alone with a maid old enough
to be a duenna—but far too shrewd to attempt it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother sulked on a very uncomfortable stool—too
high for feet—very much too low for one’s legs to
be conveniently or painlessly disposed of. Emmeline
had been crying; her eyes were redder than her lightly
rouged cheeks. Reginald looked thunderous. Each had
close at hand a cocktail—larger than cocktails usually
are made. The Reginald’s—he liked to be called so—was
served in a champagne glass; Emmeline’s in a small bowl
which she called a Chinese wine cup—but Li Po himself
never drank wine out of any vessel half so ample, for it
was almost as large as a small afternoon tea-cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you it’s true!” the girl sobbed, between a whiff
and a sip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not believe it!” Reginald liked the suggestion
almost as little as Miss Julia had—and by it his personal
vanity was stung, which Miss Julia Townsend’s had not
been. “That low Chink——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline threw out a dramatic hand, scattering ash
into the embossed scales of the purple kimono’s handsomest
dragon. “Not here!” she hissed. “No one that
speaks with less than the deepest respect for Sên King-lo
shall dare speak it here. He is Celestial!” and she sank
back with an adoring moan on her prickly cushions—a
stork’s leg rasped her cheek—but she was too highly or
abjectly Chinese to wince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rot!” Reginald replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to his cocktail; she pulled broken-heartedly
at her cigarette. She had a pretty collection of tiny
pipes—Chinese and otherwise—but, like the chop-sticks,
they had mastered her, not she them. She industriously
kept them conspicuous, but she couldn’t manage to use
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reggie,” she said presently, “can’t we help each
other, you and I? Let’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” He spoke gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald acquiesced—if he did—by discreet silence,
and waited for his sister to do the thinking; a process
more in her line than in his—as they both knew, though
Reginald rarely referred to the fact. He had but two
gifts, beauty of person and splendor of raiment. Emmeline
Hamilton was versatile and not without brains. Her
silliness was a pose—his a reality and an emptiness.
She affected asceticism and languor. He affected nothing
but his surprising English accent. Even it he found
no small strain and fatigue. If she had been born a boy,
she might have attained to as successful and profitable
a mountebankry as their father’s. Success, except in an
almost floral display of haberdashery, was not for Reginald
de Courcy Hamilton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to marry her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep.” He rarely wasted his English <span class='it'>en famille</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are determined? Perfectly? She hasn’t a
cent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m nothing of the sort. She won’t have me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve asked her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. No use not giving her the whole lay of
the land, if she was to work her wits on it to advantage.
But he wasn’t going to dwell on that part of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that to do with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably everything. You answer; I’ll do the
asking. When?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty of times,” he muttered viciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since she’s seen so much of Sên King-lo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sên King-lo be blowed! I tell you he has nothing to
do with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you he has. Did you propose, the first time,
since the last Rosehill garden party? It was there they
met. Mary Withrow told me so. Was it after that that
you proposed to Ivy Gilbert the first time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald growled and nodded. His vanity was writhing.
But as far as it was in him to care for any one but
himself, he cared for Ivy Gilbert—and cared for her
somewhat surprisingly for one of his type and of his
selfishness, since he wished to marry a penniless girl—which
was precisely what he always had purposed never
to do. He wanted Ivy. And, if Emmeline could help
him to it, she’d have to have questions answered. He
saw that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline lit a fresh cigarette and lay with her pale
eyes darkly fixed on the ceiling—hatching her plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it! We must make him believe that she has
jilted you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you!” Gratitude could not have sounded
more thankless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she could be made to believe that I was engaged
to him, or had been——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Em,” her brother broke in hotly, “I won’t
listen to such disgusting rot. You engaged, even in fun,
to a Chink! Don’t you dare say such a thing again,
even to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline laughed thinly. There was little she did not
dare do—Reg was the weaker vessel, quite without influence
on the sister who, under a trailing, floppy affectation
of languor, was an intensely vital young woman;
and they both knew it. Their parents both consulted
Emmeline frequently and usually followed her advice
when they sought it. More than once she had had a
strong finger in a sermon-pie of her father’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were engaged to Sên King-lo it wouldn’t be in
fun,” she remarked with a hungry sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop it, I tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Hamilton paid no attention to her brother’s
rising wrath—a nearer manliness than he often reached—and
very little and cool attention to his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d bring a breach-of-promise suit against him,” she
went on, “if I had one iota to go on. But I haven’t. I
haven’t a scratch of his pen. I’ve written him notes
about all sorts of things, but he telephoned the skimpiest,
formal answers—and rung off before I could get in
three words. Sên King-lo has never danced with me,”
her words trailed off in a smothered wail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald Hamilton was too disgusted to speak. He
stood up roughly and turned towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline rolled over on her big prickly cushions, face
down on them, but head held up, chin on folded arms;
and she fixed her brother with an imperious look from
light, narrowed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” she commanded. “I’ve got it! Sit
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for once Reginald Hamilton faced his manlier
sister squarely. “I won’t have you mixed up in it,
Em. Anything else you like—but not your name mixed
up with that Chink’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps Emmeline recognized the affection that lay in
his brotherly rage; for she said with another but not
ill-natured sigh. “That’s all right, old bean. It wouldn’t
work; so it isn’t our game. But, I’ve got it! Sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald sat down.</p>

<h1 id='t5708'>CHAPTER XIX</h1>

<p class='pindent'>An ominous silence reigned in the schoolroom, and
Ivy—just home from a fashionable wedding at
St. Aloysius—looked cautiously in, to see what mischief
the children were doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo sat on the floor, Blanche standing behind
him, her chubby arms pinion-tight about his neck, her
small fat hands clutched on his face. Dick sprawled at
his knees, one of Dick’s feet beating an ecstatic tattoo
on the man’s suffering trousers, not to mention the
possible pain to Sên’s leg. All three were beaming with
happiness. An array of toys, such as Ivy never had
seen, strewed the floor, and Sên King-lo was making a
procession of them as well as he could, pinioned and
manacled by the excited youngsters: grotesque Chinese
toys—animals that must have startled Darwin and Hudson—and
a gorgeous sprinkling of dolls. The little clay
animals bore a remarkable family resemblance, all were
bright orange, handsomely embellished with generous
circles of black, and the dragon looked as much like a
tiger as it did like a dragon, the tiger as much like a
dragon as it did like a tiger, the peacock—an orange
and jet-black peacock—the cormorant and the duck
looked triplets, the lion and ape and horse were fulsomely
flattering imitations of each other. There were
several imitation dwarf-trees, an ivory pagoda, a coolie-manned
junk, a mandarin under his best umbrella, a
toy-theater, all its actors complete, a peasant’s mat hut,
a buffalo working a water-wheel, a party of pig-tailed
merchants playing dice, and drinking <span class='it'>samshu</span>, a lady
with very small feet and a very large simper, quite a
<span class='it'>créche</span> of babies—one on its <span class='it'>amah’s</span> back—a monk and
a be-fanned and parasoled warrior, a litter of picture-books,
and a number of other playthings to which the
astonished governess could fit no names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three on the floor looked up as Miss Gilbert stood
in the door, and the two children frowned at the interruption.
Sên rose with a smile, Blanche pendant on his
back, strangling his neck, Dick clutched on one arm, a
gigantic top in Sên’s left hand. He held out his other
hand to Miss Gilbert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she drew back a little. “Not with that menagerie
at close quarters,” she laughed. “I know what those
two do to best dresses. Get down, children, get down at
once. Mr. Sên is not a pony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the children stayed where they were, clinging to
Sên King-lo but the tighter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me love ’im, and ’im love me,” Blanche announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See what topping things he’s brought us—from
Pekin!” Dick bade his cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy raised her eyebrows at Sên King-lo. “You made
a quick journey to Pekin and back, Mr. Sên,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, didn’t I? A record journey. I promised these
imps some real Chinese toys—weeks ago—and I wired a
friend to send them to me. They came this morning.
Do come and play with us. We are having a splendid
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you really enjoy it?” the girl asked incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love it,” Sên told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy shook her head sadly. “I don’t understand you.”
And her eyes were cold and unfriendly, Sên thought.
But he tried once more. “Won’t you?” he asked with
an effort. The zest had gone out of his voice, and its
tone was flat and perfunctory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit on the floor, and pretend I’m three? No, thank
you. Whatever are those?” she demanded—disapprovingly,
Sên thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chinese kites,” he told her dully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost a dozen were stacked in one corner—balloon-shaped
bodies with bat-shaped wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Practising for next Easter?” she queried a little
superciliously. “Where are your eggs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—we’ll get the eggs; dozens and dozens of eggs,”
Sên assured her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche gave a gurgle of delight and assaulted Sên’s
ear with a damp rosebud kiss. Ivy saw him wince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s your own fault,” she told him. “Well, I’m off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tum back to tea,” Blanche said generously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, cousin Ive—you must,” Dick added. “Mr. Sên
is having his with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to excuse me, Dick,” Ivy refused. “Mr.
Sên will pour beautifully, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dere’s doin’ to be muffens,” Blanche announced
proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ivy stood firm. “Not even for crumpets! Ba.
You are a hero, Mr. Sên.” And she left them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên bowed gravely and returned to the floor, and as
she crossed the hall she heard the great top spin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children squealed with delight, but Sên King-lo
smothered a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How desirable she’d looked there in the doorway—though
even in his mind he did not consciously word it
like that—the girl in her silvery steel-trimmed gown,
violets at her breast, and in the picture hat that shaded
her brunette face and was tied with violet ribbons
under her dimpled, mutinous chin. He had never desired
her more—and never had he desired her less—though
it never yet had occurred to him that he, intensely
Chinese, desired her at all: the girl who had no affection
for children, no share in their fresh little pleasures, no
tenderness for the baby-lives that were of her own near
kindred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Emma Snow, who noticed most things, and chattered
and laughed over many, noticed—and said nothing
about it—that for many days Sên King-lo sent no
lilies-of-the-valley to Ivy.</p>

<h1 id='t5847'>CHAPTER XX</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline Hamilton was silly—decadent even
but she was far from stupid. She made her move
at once now, but she made it deftly and unbiased or
hampered by anything that Reginald had said or that
he felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rumor began to scratch and tear at Sên King-lo, and
it did not leave Ivy Gilbert quite unscotched—though,
for a time, it left her unsmirched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was winter now, and November winds rattled leafless
branches at Arlington and on the hillside woods
above old Fort Totten’s star-shaped embankments and
cherished parapets. The Potomac crawled gray and
sullen between ice-scummed shores. If gossip and scandal
are rampant in the capital’s summer-time, in winter
they flourish like upas trees and leap to maturity and
detail like the Indian conjurer’s mango tree. Gossip
likes the fireside glow, and scandal’s a greedy drinker
of afternoon tea—likes its feet on the fender, and congenial
cronies with light heads and easy chairs close
drawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo was a roué. There was a Chinese girl
close-kept in a high-up flat over a laundry, its front
curtains never open night or day—and there were
others! He was the real proprietor of a select gambling-place.
He trafficked in opium—oh dear, yes. He got
tipsy at the Club—no one knew where he got the
stuff, but he did. It had been hushed up—though it
wouldn’t have been for an American citizen—but when
it came to a heathen Chinaman! He had tried to marry
Miss Hamilton, but she wouldn’t look at him. The
Snows ought to be more careful of their young cousin,
really they should. Of course, Sir Charles was a busy
man. But Lady Snow, one might think, might see
what was up. Marry Ivy Gilbert? Of course not.
There were other endings than that to such affairs, more
lurid endings, my dear. They were together half the
time now, <span class='it'>and at all hours</span>. They went off together on
horseback, miles and miles. A groom behind them—an
English groom? Oh dear, no—not always. And
what if he was? The tea-cups clacked on their saucers,
and the tongues clacked too—not all of them feminine
tongues. Who had passed that counterfeit bill at the
Metropolitan Club? Why was it hushed up? Who had
hushed it, and how? Sên King-lo cheated at cards.
But, dear old bean, all Chinamen did that. Early in
December the Chinese girl who lived in the close-curtained
flat over the laundry—no one seemed too sure
quite where—died. No doctor—no anything. The poor
thing’s body was taken out in the dead of night. All
bumpty-bump in a box down the laundry back stairs.
Scandalous! Taken across the river in a rowboat. What
were the police about? And buried, or disposed of
somehow—somewhere—goodness only knows where!
Isn’t it horrible? And that very same night Sên
King-lo had gone to the ball at General Howard’s—the
Howards of all people—who thought half the nicest
people in Washington not good enough to know their
girls—and Lady Egerton had danced with him—and
so had Lucy Howard—and he’d danced with Lady
Snow, and he had danced twice with the Gilbert girl.
There could be only one end to it! Of course!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rumors trickled, then swelled, and no one knew—or
cared—who was their source. And Sên King-lo
was more talked of than ever and not run after any the
less. And Ivy was cold-shouldered a little—when Lady
Snow was not looking. You couldn’t slight <span class='it'>Lady</span> Snow’s
cousin when Lady Snow was looking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one heard it all—every one but Lady Snow
herself and Ivy and Sên King-lo. Lady Snow heard
none of it. Ivy heard a good deal, but none of the
gossip that linked her name with Sên’s. All that was
worst of it reached Sên King-lo, but only the slightest
whisper of what was said of his acquaintance with Miss
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên took no notice—except that he watched the English
girl’s face with speculative, careful eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their acquaintance still waxed—though still in his
mind a flaw lingered and rankled: Ivy’s unwomanly
dislike of children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Ray heard the unclean talk at her hotel and in
several drawing-rooms; heard it and invited Mr. Sên
to dinner. Miss Townsend heard it in her Rosehill fastness
and crossed the purveyor off her visiting list—and,
after doing that two or three times, heard it no more.
Sir Charles Snow heard it all and urged Sên King-lo
the oftener to his board and encouraged him even more
cordially to Blanche and Dick’s nursery. Toys were
costing Sên King-lo almost as much now as lilies-of-the-valley
in December were. Snow and Sên never spoke
to each other of the crawling gossip. But each knew
that the other knew that they both knew; and they
smiled into each other’s eyes now and then—but no
plainer allusion passed between them, and Sên King-lo
accepted Charles Snow’s loyalty and faith as a matter
of course, and quite simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chinese Minister heard of all that was said. It
was he that told Sên; no other man could have dared—unless
Snow had cared to or thought it worth while.
The Chinese Minister told it in all its ugly grimness—but
did not speak of Miss Gilbert—but his old eyes
danced and his sides shook with mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên heard him gravely and made no comment beyond
a cold smile and a slight indifferent gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Ivy she showed Mr. Sên a warmer, franker
friendliness than she had before; and Sên understood
and was grateful and was only able to refrain from
telling her so because it was impossible to speak of
such things to a girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Emmeline Hamilton reloaded her dice and threw
them again. She did it twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A morning paper—not one of the best reputed—announced
the engagement of Sên King-lo and Miss Hamilton.
No names were mentioned, but the descriptions
of “a prominent Chicago clergyman’s daughter and
a socially conspicuous young Chinese diplomat” were
too well and accurately done to be mistakable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Washington tittered. And the Chinese Minister’s
sides shook again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Sên King-lo had been playing with Miss Gilbert all
the time—and Emmeline Hamilton had won! For she
herself had advertised her infatuation too vividly and
widely for any one at all <span class='it'>au fait</span> with the capital’s social
swimmers not to know of it—no matter what they had
said a month ago. That was how most of the breakfast
tables summed it up. But <span class='bold'>a handful</span> of other individuals
did not accept the situation so. Dr. Ray smiled
sagely when her attention was called to the paragraph—the
journal was not one which she herself read—and
then the physician’s face grew grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor girl,” she said to herself—not referring to
Ivy. The erudite Latin of an uncomfortable malady
had crossed her thought. And she had heard Joseph
Hamilton preach—once. She had not called it
“preach”; she had called it “perform.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo—like all of his race, always an early
riser—chanced in at the Club soon after breakfast,
picked up the first sheet he saw, and caught, not his
own name but the clearly pointed lines. It was not a
journal taken in at the Chinese Legation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên too smiled, even more coldly than Dr. Ray
had, purloined the page and went leisurely off towards
Judiciary Square, and, his business there done, walked
a little more briskly to Massachusetts Avenue. He
asked neither for Lady Snow nor for Sir Charles, but
for Miss Gilbert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would she ride? he asked, when she came down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “I wish I could. But it’s the
verb ‘to be’ and the boundaries of the Sea of Marmora
for me today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn them over, lock, stock and barrel—verb, sea,
children and all—to Justine. It’s a perfect day, and
I very much wish you’d come,” he urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a tempting day,” Ivy owned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—well,” she yielded, “they learn as much when
I don’t teach them as when I do; and Justine shall
hear them slaughter the verb ‘to be’ in French. Marmora
can wait a day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will wait, on all its four boundaries, for many
a day, if I’m any judge of Dick and Ba,” Sên asserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy nodded and laughed. “Ring and order Wolf
then, while I put on my habit, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” Sên told her, as he opened the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Usually Sên King-lo asked her where they should
ride, but today he took the way. And Ivy wondered
why he chose the streets he did, keeping some time
to the residential streets and circles before he turned
towards the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are we doing, Mr. Sên?” she demanded, as
they passed by the Sheridan house for the second time.
“And why are we walking? Are you trying to see
some one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one, whom I do not see,” he answered lightly.
“But one likes to be seen sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going up and down the same streets,” she
grumbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am taking a short cut,” Sên told her gravely.
And then he laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after that the girl got her canter, and they lunched
with Miss Julia—Dr. Ray chanced to be lunching also—and
rode back in the crisp of the early sunset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had no groom with them today, as now they
sometimes did not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Townsend scarcely approved of that—but she
made no remark. It was Lady Snow’s business, not
hers. And Miss Julia was no poacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two women stood at the door to see them go, and
Elenore Ray noticed that they were unattended—and
smiled. Girls often rode so in Chicago. But that was
not why the Chicago physician smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she had smiled too at lunch, when Ivy had
twitted Sên upon the slow passing and repassing up
and down the Washington streets he’d inflicted upon
them before he’d let them take the long over-river roads
for which she and their horses had longed. And again
she demanded why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sên King-lo only had laughed.</p>

<h1 id='t6089'>CHAPTER XXI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Abraham Kelly was as shrewd and polished as
he was hard: a lawyer such as only New England
can produce. He liked the Chinese Minister, and his
Chinese Excellency liked and trusted Kelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Hamilton never had met him, but she knew
of him—every one did, for he was a national asset—and
she knew him by sight; for the stern and upright old
man was an inveterate theater-goer, and rarely missed
a first night, sitting through tragedy and comedy with
equal grimness, and insisting, at the fall of every curtain,
that there never had been and never would be but one
playhouse of merit: the Boston Museum—never an
artist to compare with Annie Clarke and Baron and
Warren and Mrs. Vincent, and never a play to equal
“The Angel of Midnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline was puzzled when his card was brought
to her, but after a moment she said, “Yes—I’ll see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps Uncle Silas had died and had left her most
of his money—most sensible of him, if he had, for she’d
make better use of it than ever Reg would. Perhaps
Uncle Silas had, and Mr. Kelly had come to tell her of
her legacy. She’d wear deep mourning for her uncle,
of course, if he’d left her a lot—half or more. She loved
white, and white was Chinese mourning she knew. For,
if Miss Hamilton knew less than nothing of China, it was
not because she had not read feverishly a large number
of books telling of that country and its people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But surely her father or mother would have telegraphed,
if old Uncle Silas was dead. No—she was
afraid it couldn’t be that. Well, she’d said he could
come up—and she might as well see him, no matter
what it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to the window and arranged herself there
in an Oriental languorous attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought that the light from the window and the
background of purple, dragon-embroidered curtains,
with a candle-lantern of jangling glass beads hanging
between them, suited her well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Emmeline was looking her best today. Excitement
was tinging her thin face with almost a girlish
and pretty rose, and her pale eyes were sparkling.
She was hoping so much from the paragraph in the
paper of which several copies—blue penciled—lay about
the room conspicuously. The paragraph was in just
as she’d wished. And out of one copy of the paper
she’d cut it, and she was wearing it now in the jade
locket over her heart! She was hoping everything from
Sên King-lo’s chivalry! The Chinese were so chivalrous—all
the best authorities said so, and a man who had
spent a week in Shanghai had told her once that it was
perfectly true, and even a Presbyterian missionary
friend of her father’s to whom she had repeated it
had made no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of hoofs she turned her face to the
window, to see, who was riding by; she didn’t ride herself,
she thought it too mannish, and she didn’t enjoy
it—but she always liked to watch men who rode. And
though she never yet had seen him pass her window,
there was always a chance that it might be.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was. And a bitter look rushed into her eyes. For
Sên King-lo was speaking to Ivy Gilbert, and Ivy was
laughing back at him—neither paying any undue attention
to the horses they rode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline watched them out of sight—neither looked
up at her window—and she turned back with a paler
face as Kelly came into the room. He bowed, and then
he coughed. The clouds of smoke from the many clustering
joss-sticks had smote him, throat and nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline motioned to him languorously. “Pray be
seated, Mr. Kelly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer threw a searching glance across the remarkable
room and bowed his thanks. The inlaid stool
did not attract him, and there was nothing else to sit
on—if it was intended for seating purposes. That the
cushions on the floor were so intended did not cross his
mind—a shrewd and versatile mind, but adamantly New-Englandish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall detain you but a moment, Madam,” he said,
still standing. “My client, Mr. Sên King-lo——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but you must sit down.” Emmeline rushed at
him, and caught his arm in almost caressing fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abraham Kelly bowed and backed and extracted his
broadcloth dexterously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Sên King-lo has seen with great distress and
grave indignation the paragraph which you, I observe,
also have seen.” He pointed a lean fore-finger at the
blue-marked sheet on the nearest cocktail table. “He
has instructed me to express to you his deepest concern
that you, a lady whom he scarcely knows, should have
been libeled so scurrilously in the intolerable journalistic
falsehood.” Emmeline sighed sentimentally. “The base
and unfounded insinuation will be withdrawn, contradicted
and apologized for in tomorrow’s issue. I already
have seen the editor and the proprietor and
myself dictated the contradiction and the apology. But
my client wishes me to express to you his indignation
and regret. If we can find the original culprit, I am
instructed to push the case to the severest limit our
laws provide, unless—<span class='it'>unless</span> you, Madam, would prefer,
for obvious reasons, that the matter be dropped and we
all rest satisfied with the withdrawal and apology. It
is for you to decide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to see Mr. Sên himself about it first,”
Emmeline said sentimentally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I fear will be impossible now,” the lawyer
replied regretfully. “Having put the matter in my
hands, my client cannot speak on the matter except
through me. We lawyers are sticklers, you know, and
the Chinese are punctilious—and none more so than
Mr. Sên King-lo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” Emmeline snapped. “I insist upon seeing
Mr. Sên about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Impossible,” the lawyer told her tersely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall write to him,” Miss Hamilton insisted sulkily.
“Mr. Sên himself and I will decide what we are going
to do about it. I had a right to be consulted <span class='it'>before</span> you
went to the paper—not after. It’s as much my affair
as Mr. Sên’s. And I don’t propose to be left out of it.
I shall telephone the newspaper at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kelly bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I shall write to King-lo,” she repeated hysterically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he will hand your note to me to answer,”
the lawyer told her smoothly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show a woman’s letter—her personal letter—to <span class='it'>you</span>!
He couldn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me; he would have to. And I have seen
many women’s personal letters.” He smiled a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall mark it ‘Private,’ ” the girl almost hissed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer bowed. But hard as he was—all buckram
and broadcloth and relentless procedure—he was
sorry for the unstrung pallid creature facing him. He
had diagnosed her as Dr. Ray had—as quickly and convincedly.
Lawyers see as much, perhaps, of that complex
as physicians do—even in New England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will let me know—when you have considered
it—your decision as to whether we are to ferret out,
as we undoubtedly can, the originator of the false and
abominable falsehood, or to let that part of it drop.
Our only wish is to spare you further annoyance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll let Mr. Sên know,” Miss Hamilton answered
haughtily. “You are not my lawyer. I’ll choose my
own lawyer, if I want one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kelly bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I insist—” she began hotly; but Abraham Kelly had
bowed himself out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline stood for several moments where he’d left
her, limp with rage, her thin breast heaving painfully,
her clenched hands raised above her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As his footsteps died away, she threw herself face
downwards on her cushions, and broke into hard, tearless
sobs, her nervous fingers picking convulsively at
the pillows’ silks and tinsels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo’s chivalry had failed her. And he was
riding with Ivy Gilbert!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she scorned her defeat. She was not through
yet, and she’d throw her dice again.</p>

<h1 id='t6287'>CHAPTER XXII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Gilbert heard of the paragraph of course;
every one did. She heard of it that evening, but
she gave it even less thought than Sir Charles did; for
he wondered idly who had inspired it and why, but
Ivy did not even do that. She heard of it, but she
did not trouble to read it, and Emma, watching, wondered
if she’d been mistaken in believing that Ivy had
come to take more than a friendly interest in Mr. Sên.
If she did, she gave no sign now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the ugly stories that were clouding Sên’s name
more persistently every day, no word ever had been
spoken by Lady Snow as yet. Emma Snow had no
wish to mention them to her cousin, and had she wished,
which she did not, to speak of them to Sir Charles,
would not have dared do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after the morning journal had eaten
its yesterday’s words, Lady Snow’s drawing-room was
very full even for her “at home” day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emmeline Hamilton came very early, and finding a
moment and a corner alone with Ivy, said suddenly, “Do
you care for King-lo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy stiffened. “Do I what, Miss Hamilton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that my brother cares for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will not discuss that,” Ivy cut her short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Sên King-lo is all the world to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—hush,” Ivy cried, ashamed to her core that any
girl could be so brazen—for such she considered the
other’s avowal of feeling for a man with whom, as
Ivy knew, her acquaintance was very slight. It did not
shock her at all that Miss Hamilton had come to care
for a Chinese—for she, Ivy herself, had ceased to think
of Sên King-lo as of a race apart and debarred and
even unconsciously thought of him as of one far less
alien to her than most of the men she met here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is,” Emmeline went desperately on, “and I don’t
care who knows it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is evident,” Ivy Gilbert thought. But she
said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—and he’d have been engaged to me now, if it
wasn’t for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is preposterous,” Ivy interrupted indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> preposterous,” Emmeline agreed quickly; “for
he does not care for you really, and I don’t believe that
you care for him. If you do care for him, say so—”
Ivy’s lip curled—“and then it will be a fair fight between
you and me. But, if you don’t, won’t you give
him back to me? I want him. Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you must be mad, and I know you are
disgusting,” Ivy rather panted, looking at Emmeline
with horror-widened eyes, and moving to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Emmeline caught at her wrist with vise-like thin
fingers; and short of making a scene in Emma’s drawing-room,
where already a few other guests were trickling
in, there was no escape. So she sat down again.
You must humor lunatics; she had always heard that.
Well—she hoped she’d not meet another lunatic soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Answer me! You shall! Do you care for King-lo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like Mr. Sên—as I think every one does,” Ivy
said coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy bent her head, with a look of contempt straight
into Emmeline’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—he is perfect!” Emmeline bleated. “Will you
give him back to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot give what is not mine. And I will not
listen to any more insult—not if I have to appeal to
my cousin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he coming here today?” Emmeline pleaded abjectly,
a sudden change in tone and manner. Dr. Ray
would have read it apprehensively; but Ivy was merely
blankly amazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know,” she answered truthfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he give you those flowers you are wearing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that was too much—scene or no scene. Miss
Gilbert rose again, and this time the other made no
attempt to stay her but called after her, “I know he
did,” in an overstrained voice that made heads turn
and eyebrows raise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Guests came and went, but Emmeline Hamilton stayed.
Lady Snow looked at her curiously more than once.
Ivy kept out of her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was growing late, but half a dozen tardy comers
lingered over the blazing logs and tinkling tea-cups, and
Emmeline pushed into the group, shivering a little, and
drawing about her thin, lightly clad shoulders the long-drooping
fur that she had not left in the hall. Her
mood had changed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were speaking of Sên King-lo,” she said—but
no one had mentioned him there. “Every one is. It
is odious that he should be tolerated among us. He
ought to be horsewhipped out of the place.” And in
spite of Lady Snow’s imperative gesture, she plunged
into all the recent scandal—even into noisome details.
And Sên King-lo came into the room as she shrilly
told one nauseous item. “Had you heard all this?”
she demanded pointedly of Ivy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—all, though worded less uncomfortably, I’m
glad to say, than you have,” Miss Gilbert said clearly,
rising and crossing the room to Sên King-lo, who stood
in the doorway with Sir Charles Snow beside him.
“Good afternoon Mr. Sên,”—it was then that the other
women turned and saw him,—“I was wishing you’d
come. I want you to ride with me tomorrow. Will
you take me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know how glad I always am,” he replied,
as she gave him her hand. His face had not changed as
he had unavoidably heard Emmeline’s last sentences.
But his eyes flashed into Ivy’s as he held her fingers,
and then he turned and went to his hostess, cool and
quiet as he always was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ivy spoke to him again as soon as Emma had
greeted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you for my lilies,” she said with a glance
down at them, and a smile into his eyes: “they are lovelier
than ever today, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Sên could reply—and he never was slow—Miss
Hamilton rose from her chair dramatically; but
before she could speak, Sir Charles Snow gave her his
arm and led her courteously from the room. Sên
King-lo went to the door and opened and held it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others went almost at once, and Lady Snow
went into the hall with the last to go and did not
come back. But she said to Sên as she passed him, “Do
stay and dine—we’ll none of us dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I stay?” Sên asked Ivy, as the closed door
left them alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to,” she answered. “And thank you
again for my lilies. Won’t you have a few sprays—they’ll
dress you for dinner—as they do me,” and she
held out the sprays she’d pulled from her dress as
she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So they will,” Sên said, as he bowed over the tiny
white bells of perfume and the fingers that gave them.
“Thank you.”</p>

<h1 id='t6465'>CHAPTER XXIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>They rode the next day, and Ivy suggested “a
Washington ride,” but Sên laughed and turned
Sinbad towards the Potomac, across the bridge, into
the icicled country roads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No mention was made, of course, as none had been
made the evening before, of the cancerous rumors with
which society’s amiable chit-chat had been teeming for
weeks, and the ugliest detail of which Emmeline had
retailed shrilly yesterday as Sên stood within unavoidable
earshot in Lady Snow’s drawing-room. But they
felt a deeper companionship today than they had before;
a more basic and secured good-fellowship, absolutely
devoid of sentimentality, as little fettered or
fed by sex as waxing comradeships between a man and
a girl, congenial and heart-free, can be; a good-fellowship
not unlike the friendship of Sên and Charles
Snow, wholesomely and strongly rooted in a mutual respect
which both felt could neither be destroyed nor
damaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of the cold, they rode slowly now and then.
For the winter-kissed waysides were indescribably
lovely, and Sên King-lo could not pass that loveliness
quickly by. To him it was as if God had painted in
silver and white and black the long out-rolled picture
of the inimitable landscape’s scroll; painted and limned
it, and breathed His high living message into it
more supremely, more beautifully, than ever even the
master-brush of great Ma Yuen had. They spoke to
Sên King-lo and tingled his Chinese soul: the long sweeps
of glorious panoramic beauty, with each tiniest black
leafless twig softened by cuddling little drift-patches of
spotless snow and sparkling with diamond dew-drops of
ice. To the English girl it looked just fairyland, exquisitely
beautiful, quite unreal—and she heard no
message. Such the difference of her Western spirit and
eyes and his of the East. She saw it a wonderful spectacle
and was glad she’d come; he merged in it, and forgot
self—and was silent. And from his silence, the
far-look in his eyes, the slight flush on his face, she
caught something of his mood, too, perhaps, <span class='it'>just</span> a
something of his spirit. They never before had been
so close—or so far. She echoed his pleasure, but could
not share his absorption; she alien here, in the white
Virginia woods, with snow and thin gleams of ice
where ice and snow come but rarely, the white passion
of December rapturously calling Earth its bride.
Sên King-lo felt at home; for the hour, no longer
afar from China. Not once in many years does winter
show so in England. In his Chinese home Sên had
seen winter so a thousand times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lingered—but as the sun sank, backing the
black and gray tree-trunks with royal colors, they turned
back towards the city. As they neared it the girl
turned her head at the quick clatter of hoofs behind
them—gaining upon them, almost, she thought, as if
in pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again today no groom was with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw who it was and turned her head back with
an impatient frown on her face but said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo did not see Reginald Hamilton until
Hamilton drew his horse neck and neck with Sên’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hamilton did not lift his hat, and King-lo’s slim
fingers tightened slightly on his riding-crop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald was winded, a little. He was no great horseman,
and he had been drinking—though not to excess.
It was physical inconvenience and personal emotion that
quivered and belched him far more than bourbon and
bitters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll deal with you later, you yellow, opium-sodden
chimpanzee,” he cried thickly, with an insulting motion
of his whip. “Be off with you now! I’ll not allow you
to ride with this lady. Don’t let me catch you so much
as speaking to her again, you vermin-fed laundry whelp!
Understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên smiled slightly, his eyes perfectly quiet, and
turned to the girl beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please ride on a little, Miss Gilbert,” he asked easily.
“I won’t be a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Ivy told him. “I stay with you. Are you
going to kill him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In <span class='it'>your</span> presence? No, not even whip him—merely
set him on his feet. Please go. I’ll be with you almost
at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy did not answer him. She had grown very white—but
not with fear, not even with nervousness, Sên
knew. She sat perfectly still, and she did not move
or speak again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald raised his whip, a little unsteadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chinese man leisurely threw his reins over one
arm, the loop of his crop over one finger, leaned lightly
a little from his saddle, caught Reginald Hamilton by
the arms, and swung him down to the ground—not
roughly—setting him square on his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên gave the riderless horse an imperative but friendly
tap on its flank with his crop, and it started off at a
slow trot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald stood stock-still; purple, spluttering, wordless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it’ll find its stable,” Sên said to Ivy lightly.
“I daresay it will; they usually do. Shall we walk
our horses on, Miss Gilbert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went on in silence, and after a few moments,
because he saw how white and cold the girl’s face
looked, Sên set a faster pace, and they kept it until,
as they passed the Louise Home, Ivy slackened her reins
and looked at him with a tinkle and gurgle of girlish
laughter, which Sên King-lo, as Sir Charles did, always
thought had a sound of China.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her with a question in his smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking,” she told him—“I don’t think you’ll
mind, we are good friends——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best of friends,” Sên King-lo said gravely,
holding his hat in his hand as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking of your hands, Mr. Sên, and of a
silly thing I thought the first time we met—in the
summer—at Miss Julia’s——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not forgotten where I first saw you,” Sên
said, with no hint or sound of hidden meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your hands—they are different—you know”—Ivy
hesitated a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chinese,” Sên said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” the girl nodded, “and not very thick, and I
wondered—that night at Miss Julia’s—how much use
they’d be at fisticuffs. I know now, Mr. Sên.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let the chamois loop on her riding-crop just fleck
the hand on his horse’s bridle as she spoke, her eyes
freemason friendly on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên lay his hand on her pommel for a moment.
“Chinese hands,” he told her, “that always will serve
to take care of you when you allow me to be your
escort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that,” the girl said quietly.</p>

<h1 id='t6634'>CHAPTER XXIV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>The story of Reginald Hamilton’s last ride in
Washington never got out. His horse found its
way back to its stable, quite uninjured, and that, plus
a check for a bill never before too promptly paid, satisfied
the liveryman who owned it. Unlike Washington
society, he was not curious. And neither Ivy nor Sên
King-lo told any one—for some weeks not even Sir
Charles. Had Hamilton stayed on in Washington,
probably both his cousin and their friend would have
felt that Snow must be told—that he, the only man in
America who had a right to do it, might stand between
the girl and any further advances of the Reginald. But
a week after his descent to the snow-thick road, Reginald
and his sister, together, though not on speaking terms,
betook them to Chicago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald Hamilton had been away from Washington
for a few days when Emmeline had achieved her newspaper
<span class='it'>coup</span>; and on his return, after the ill-fated paragraph’s
contradiction, she had managed to prevent him
from attempting a tardy intervention. But he had heard
all about it, of course; and, though not quite dull enough
to doubt that the invention had been Emmeline’s, with
intention and hope behind it, it had humiliated as well as
enraged him; and this, added to his thwarted and growing
passion for Ivy, had swung him quite off his balance
of mind and breeding, never very secure. And his outrageous
and, because futile, absurd behavior had been,
at least in part, a demented blow struck in his sister’s
defense. He, craven though he was, would have slain
Emmeline himself before he’d have seen her married to
a Chinese; but he was infuriated that Chinese Sên
King-lo had scorned the hint which, as Hamilton (and
all Washington) knew, Emmeline more than once had
given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By mid-January the rumors that had smirched Sên’s
name had died away and made room for others about
some one else. Washington society has too many sensations
to dawdle long over one—and too many great
interests to quite lose its head over things that are in
truth as uninteresting as they are vicious and petty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên still rode and walked with Ivy, had long Anglo-Chinese
conferences with Snow, still played with Dick
and Blanche, sometimes carrying them off to have several
hours of high-jinks in his own rooms. Sir Charles
went there sometimes, and Emma Snow had had tea
there with Sên King-lo twice and had lunched there once
with Sên and Miss Julia: a very great and unmerited
honor for Sên, Uncle Lysander thought. Kow Li had
a different opinion which he kept to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy had not been invited. Mary Withrow and Lucille
Smith wondered why. Emma Snow and Dr. Ray, who
still was in Washington, thought they knew, but, like
Kow Li, each kept her opinion strictly to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great English statesman was the lion of the January
hour. His name was world-known, and he had married
a minor royalty. He was staying with the Snows, and
Lady Snow’s big drawing-room was insufficient for her
callers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles and his wife had gone with the Duke to
the White House an hour ago, and Sên King-lo and Ivy
were looking at the confession her cousin’s guest had
written just before dinner; the first contribution of
that sort she had asked for since Sên’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That reminds me,” she said, as he closed the book,
and she took it from him and opened it again, turning
the pages until she found his, “I’ve always meant to
ask you or Charlie and always forgotten to do it—I’ve
such a sieve of a head.” She laid her finger below the
character that stood for a woman’s name. “Will you
pronounce it for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên spoke the Chinese word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made him repeat it and tried to say it after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it would take me years! What an appalling
language!” She laughed at him. “But I like your
favorite name, Mr. Sên. I like its sound when you say
it. I think it is beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most beautiful word in the world to me,” Sên
said—“the most beautiful name in the world. We
Chinese are said to crave only sons. But as long as
I can remember, my heart’s desire has been to have
a daughter whose mother would let me give her that
name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke quite simply, for all his English training,
too Chinese to feel any mawkish hesitancy in speaking to
a friend, a girl he respected, of life’s best realities.
Something that hurt a little, something new and strange,
pricked at Ivy Gilbert’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo’s wife! His Chinese wife! She had never
thought of her. She always had thought of him as
just Sên King-lo—the Sên King-lo she knew and liked
and talked with and rode with—unmarried, here in
Washington to stay. More often than not she forgot
that he was not English, more alien than she was,
alien very differently from her. Of course he’d go
back to China—and marry there—some day. Why
not? How silly she was! <span class='it'>All</span> Chinese married. She
didn’t know much about them, but she knew that much.
Had his ancestors worn pig-tails? Even his own father,
perhaps! It was a horrid thought. She looked up from
the Chinese page of her book to the Chinese man on the
other side of the small, low table between them, a
sudden fear, a revulsion, in her young English eyes—and
looked down again very quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you couldn’t write it in English,” she
spoke a little breathlessly; “you had to leave the space
blank. There isn’t any English name for the Chinese
name, of course. You couldn’t translate it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he told her, “that was not the reason. There
is an English translation for many Chinese names—and
this is one. I have written it in English—once or twice,”
he added with a smile that neither he nor she understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why—” she began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my girl-mother’s name, Miss Gilbert, and
I love it for that, even far more than I do for the
music it makes—it <span class='it'>is</span> music in <span class='it'>my</span> language and in yours.
It was the last word my father ever spoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” Ivy told him shyly. “I’m
so sorry. Of course, you wouldn’t write it in my
confession-book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I did. I wrote it in Chinese. I’ll write it now
in English, if you’ll let me. I didn’t when I wrote
the English pages, because I could not take that liberty
with <span class='it'>your</span> name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo’s eyes kindled into hers. “My mother’s
name”—his lips seemed to caress it as he spoke it—“was
Ruby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>And then the girl knew.</span></p>

<h1 id='t6791'>CHAPTER XXV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo did not know—yet. But Ivy knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost always the woman knows first—no matter
how inexperienced she is, or how experienced he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy knew. And because she reeled a little under the
shock—and all that it meant—she blundered into words
that were the last she’d have spoken, if she and her
tongue had known what they were doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How odd! Your mother’s name was Ruby Sên.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew what she’d said the moment she’d said it,
and she flushed, face and neck, almost as crimson as
a Chinese’s bride’s veil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even then the man did not know—neither his secret
nor hers. But the first far-off glimmering of his own
came to him then—like the shimmering scent of distant
flowers or the tremble of music a long way away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Ivy’s confusion, the red on her face, and that
her lips and hands trembled a little. But he mistook
it to be only her vexation for a <span class='it'>faux pas</span> that the sensitive
taste of so nice a girl exaggerated out of all
proportion to the small thing it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But no,” he reminded her with a light laugh, “it was
not—it was Sên Ruby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy laughed too then. But the odd inverted sound
of it hurt her—“Sên Ruby”—reminding her, admonishing
her, of the bar eternally set, the race-bar that
decency—or was it prejudice?—set between East and
West. <span class='it'>She</span> never could leap that bar, and she knew
that he never would. “English-Chinese!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was glad when Sên King-lo went to the piano.
(Was it tact or because he felt like playing? she wondered.
It was both.) And she was still more glad
when Emma came in with Sir Charles and the Duke.
And as soon as she decently could she said goodnight
and left them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was very weary as she trudged up the easy stairs—and
her young soul was bitter. Other girls kept
their dreams—at least for a time—but she might not
keep hers for an hour—not for one heart-beat of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chinese!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lay awake a long time wishing the day would
come, dreading its coming. She did not hear the front
door close, but she heard Sên’s step as it passed under
her window, and she smothered her ears in her pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was almost morning when at last she slept, and
she dreamed of Sên King-lo’s wife—his Chinese wife
and hated her. She dreamed of Sên King-lo in Chinese
dress—skirts, hair, and all—and loathed herself. She
mocked herself, and his eyes mocked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She woke to a rush of thought—the thought that
her name was “Ruby” and that she was more glad of
that than she ever had been of anything else. Charles
called her “Ruby” almost as often as he did “Ivy.”
What a pale insipid name “Ivy” was—a silly name.
Why hadn’t they called her only “Ruby”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, the shame and the pain of it all! To have given
her love unasked, unsought, unwanted! And to a
man of a debarred race! But why? Why was it
debarred? Did he know? Did he suspect it? Had she
told him? She shivered down in her warm bed and
closed her miserable eyes—ashamed to have even the
daylight see her. How was she to face Emma and
Charlie—<span class='it'>and</span> Sên King-lo? He must never know. Whatever
he believed now, led to by her, she must convince
him that he had made an absurd mistake. She would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At breakfast Sir Charles smiled affectionately at her,
glad to see her so happy and full of fun, and the Duke
chuckled more than once. Marie should ask her to
stay with them when the Snows came home, and if
Rupert fell in love with her—who cared? Not Rupert’s
father. Not he! But Emma, watching and listening,
grew grave at heart, and her eyes were anxious though
her lips smiled. How Charlie would hate it! Her poor
Charlie! If only they’d left Ivy at home in England!</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Lady Snow knew what neither Ivy nor Sên
King-lo did and had little doubt of how it would end.
But she feared that in the meantime Ivy was going to
be very ill. The girl was drinking too much coffee,
and she was forcing herself to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All day Ivy listened for a voice and a footstep. She
longed not to see Sên King-lo again. But her pride told
her she must; and, more than she wished not to face him
again, she longed to do so and get it well over. She’d
carry her head high to the last. And she’d find an
excuse to go back to England after Easter. She never
had promised to stay with Emma and Charles forever.
Whatever she’d do there, however she’d contrive to live
there, she did not know. But that did not matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo did not come that day. But he sent
flowers in his stead—although he had sent her some only
yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Today—for the first time since he <span class='it'>had</span> sent them—he
sent her no lilies. When Ivy opened the florist’s box
it held only roses—deep-scented, red roses the color of
rubies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy tucked two or three in her belt; it would look
less strange, perhaps, to Sên, if he came, than if she
did not, she thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and Lady Snow lunched alone that day, and
Emma wondered who had sent those roses—but didn’t
ask or look at them particularly. But at dinner the
Duke had no such scruple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have changed your flowers,” he remarked. “I
thought you always wore lilies-of-the-valley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always. A friend gives me lilies sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather often,” the Duke observed slyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bought my red roses,” Ivy continued, “and I
paid dear for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flowers are a scandalous price in winter,” the
Duke agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These were!” Ivy laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Snow shot her a covert glance. Why had Ivy told
that lie? There was no need for her to have said anything.
She had not bought those roses. The house
was full of flowers always, and Ivy always was free of
them all. Ivy’s money went, almost to a dollar, on
clothes. How had they cost her dear? That much
had sounded true to Emma Snow’s quick ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way,” Sir Charles asked presently, “what
was Blanche crying so hard over this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy flushed and answered. “She was in a temper
because I would not give her one of my roses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men looked surprised. How unlike Ivy,
Sir Charles thought, and was puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Snow crumbled her bread. She was not puzzled.
She knew now. Sên King-lo had sent those roses. But
how had Ivy paid dear for them—the flowers of which
she would not spare Blanche even one? Had she refused
Sên King-lo last night? She—Emma—feared not.</p>

<h1 id='t6959'>CHAPTER XXVI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Two more days passed, and then Sên came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy met him gaily, bearing herself so naturally,
her gaiety so unexaggerated, that she almost deceived
herself and must have deceived him completely, if it
ever had entered his head that she cared for him at all
beyond friendliness—which it never had. He knew the
signs of open and almost-open infatuation; these signs
had been hurled at him too hard and too persistently
not to have driven their flagrant message in. But the
signs of a rapprochement that gave no sign and offered
or asked no approach were hidden from his sharp eyes.
And the warming inclination of an essentially modest
girl, who also was both proud and self-in-hand, showed
not at all to Sên, who not only was not vain, but even
was modest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their camaraderie went on as it had. Ivy was too
proud to check it at all, and after a little, even to her
shocked sensitiveness, much of the gnawing bitterness
wore away, and all the pleasure and sweetness stayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her disgust and self-revulsion because she had turned
in personal affection—emotion even—to a man so set
from her by race quite slipped away, and only her shame
at loving unloved and unsought remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she found it hard to remember that Sên was
Chinese—less of her own race than a Spaniard or Russian
was. It was <span class='it'>he</span>, his personality that appealed to
and pleased her, and she did not realize that his race
was a strong and essential part of both, and that in
both he was intensely Chinese. To her he was merely
the man, because so much <span class='it'>the</span> man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when she did think about it—that he was Chinese,
she English—it gradually grew to her a lesser and almost
negligible thing. Chinese and English of gentle
birth did not marry. But <span class='it'>was</span> it a sound decency or only
a cheap and sorry prejudice that barred the way? Inherited
reason said “decency,” but her heart and her
own estimate of Sên, her own satisfaction and ease in
his companionship, leaned to the other answer. She
ceased to feel any shame that she had given her love—for
she was relentlessly frank with herself as to that—to
an Asian. But that she had let herself care for
a man who gave her no thought of that sort in return
shamed her cruelly. And she guarded her secret well—now
that she knew it herself. Her ignorance had
been her danger-time. It was past. She guarded it so
well that she deceived eyes sharper to the thing she hid
than were the eyes of unsuspecting Sên King-lo. And
he had no need to guard. It is easy enough to hide
what does not exist. Even Lady Snow began to think
that her alarm had barked up a phantom tree, and
laughed at herself—and was glad. And Sir Charles
laughed up his sleeve at his fanciful wife, and Miss
Julia laughed scornfully up hers at Elenore Ray. And
only Dr. Ray was not deceived—and said nothing. She
saw it all—saw even what neither Ivy nor Sên did.
And things went on between Sên King-lo and the English
girl as they had—but they went; they did not
stand quite stock still. Things are not apt to do that
between a man and a maid in springtime. He told
her more and more of China than he had, and she
learned how to write her second name in Chinese,
and one day—it was almost May—Sên King-lo filled
the blank he had left in the confession-book. And Ivy
locked the book away—not to be written in again, she
intended. But she took it out and looked in it sometimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In April the spring was coming. Soft sticky things
showed on the leaf-bare trees, if you looked close enough.
The grass was reasserting itself. Poor people slacked
their fires. Fruit from “down South” was cheaper.
Stuffs in the drygoods shops were thinner and paler.
The skies gave a promise of summer. The moon laughed
again, and some days at noontide the Potomac laughed
back at the sun. The magnolia on Miss Julia’s sunniest
wall hinted of buds, and then the buds began to swell,
and Lysander and Dinah sorted out turkey-wings and
long-handled brooms of peacocks’ feathers against the
coming of flies, and spoke of “them ornery niggah’s
summer cloes,” and dreamed at night of big watermelons
and green peas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy just glanced at the house on the other side of the
street as she and Sên passed it as they were walking
together one late April day. She knew from the number
that he lived over there and, from what Emma had
said, which were his sitting-room windows, but she
never had happened to pass it on foot and in day-time.
She had sent notes to him there, but she was not a girl
who would go to look where a man friend lived. She
made no remark about it now, and neither did he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are wrong,” he was saying. “As I
read it, Ruskin meant——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy caught his arm and gave a cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two small spotted ponies had dashed madly around
the corner from M Street, not quite missing the sharp
curb; ponies she usually drove herself when the children
<span class='it'>would</span> go and Watkins could not be spared. A
very small groom with a very white face was seesawing
wildly at the reins, just the one thing to infuriate the
already crazily maddened ponies. Who had trusted
Buttons to drive? Where was Charlie? Was Emma
mad? Justine should go for this. Blanche was sobbing
and screaming betimes. Dick seemed in scarcely
manlier shape, and just as Sên dashed towards the
ponies and caught their bridles as in a vise, Dick
screamed, and jumped. Buttons gave a superhuman
wrench at the reins—one rein broke—and the low
phaeton lurched over. Both the children were pinioned
under its wreck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maddened ponies squealed with fear and rage.
They were trembling violently, but they moved on not
an inch more. Sên King-lo was holding them. He dared
not leave their heads, but Ivy, steeling herself to go
to him, saw the agony on his face as he looked at the
turned-over trap under which the children lay. The
boy driver sat on the sidewalk crying weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you pull the whip out from under there—it
is under the wheel—and give him a cut?” Sên asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he is hurt,” Ivy murmured shakily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care if he is dead,” Sên snapped. “You
and he must lift it off those babies. Be quick! But
first put your hand in my pocket—trouser pocket—this
left one—get my knife—open it. Can you cut the
traces? Be quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fumbled with the knife, but—though she ripped
her light glove and tore her nail—she could not open
the blade. The ponies were plunging wildly, and they
were strong little beasts—only the man holding them
now ever would know how strong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên called sharply to the boy squat on the curb;
but Buttons sat still and continued to blubber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold it up to my mouth—but look out for their
hoofs!” Sên told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy obeyed, but as his teeth tugged at the blade—perhaps
her hands trembled a little in spite of her,
for a moan of pain came from under the overturned
phaeton—the blade slipped and a trickle of blood went
from Sên’s lip to his stern-set chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now cut the traces. You must!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy tried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saw—saw like hell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moments seemed like hours. Sên knew that the
sinews of his left arms were perilously strained—that
was nothing, if only their strength held—and Ivy
thought that she was only scratching the strong leather
she tried to cut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oddly so at this hour, the street seemed deserted—no
other help in sight or call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One trace gave a little—then snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other!” Sên commanded. “Don’t get too near
when you go round. Keep clear of their legs. Be as
quick as you can!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought her strength was failing; she knew her
legs shook; but she made the attempt and reached the
other side and feebly attacked the second trace. Sên’s
task was harder now, because of the one severed trace
which, light as the little carriage was, had served in
the entanglement as some slight cheek on the plunging,
straining ponies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A window went up, a colored woman looked out and
screamed. A perambulator jolted round the corner.
Small beginnings and not helpful ones; but the inevitable
crowd was coming at last, and just as the
knife slipped from Ivy’s unnerved fingers, a very fat,
deliberate policeman sauntered into sight. But he
was worthy his uniform, for he instantly saw his need
and filled it; ran to Sên’s side, blowing his whistle
as he ran, and caught at the near pony’s bit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can hold them,” Sên said. “Get the trap off—carefully—there
are children under it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There would be!” the policeman grumbled. But
again he lost no time, and as men and women, sundry
children and dogs, and a cautious sprinkling of cats
thickened the street into a crowd, and more heads
showed at windows, and people on steps, he, unaided,
lifted the wreck off, clear from the little bodies beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was blood. Dick lay badly still. Blanche was
moaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Help had come to Sên in abundance now—another
policeman, a handsome young Jew—who didn’t need
to be told, but did it; a maiden lady who wore a green
beige veil over a New England bombazine bonnet and
steel-rimmed spectacles on her high-bridged nose; a
Jesuit priest and a Salvation corporal. The men were
enough to hold the still struggling runaways as securely
as Sên had done alone; and the ponies already were
growing quieter under the hand and the voice of the
old New England woman, speaking to them companionably,
as she fearlessly stroked and patted them. So
Sên King-lo, with questioning torture in his eyes, Saxon
pallor on his tawny face, and sickening pain in his
shoulders, left the newcomers in charge there, and
went to Ivy just in time to see her kneel down and
gather Blanche up in her arms. He saw how gently
she did it, saw the look on her face, the tears in her
eyes, and that she would not let them fall, and he
saw the welcoming gladness on the welcoming baby
face as Ivy lifted Blanche up and nested the child’s
bleeding face against her girlish breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên lifted motionless Dick and bent his ear to the
boy’s face. Dick was breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They carried the children up to Sên’s rooms—the
constables protesting and suggesting the ambulance.
But they accepted Ivy’s, “I am their cousin,” Sên
King-lo’s more imperative, “’Phone for their father
—Sir Charles Snow—British Embassy;—Massachusetts
Avenue, if he’s gone home. I am taking them to my
rooms.” And the policeman who had seen Sên holding
the demented ponies even put his finger up to his
helmet.</p>

<h1 id='t7207'>CHAPTER XXVII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Dick, more frightened than hurt, was carried home
that same night; but wee Blanche was badly hurt,
and the doctor would not allow them to move her. The
wound on her head was a bad one, her little arm was
broken, one baby leg crushed, and most of all the doctors,
who came and went hourly, feared internal injuries they
could not gage and dare not probe yet. For two weeks
the child lay swathed and drugged in Sên King-lo’s
bed. And Ivy never left her. Even in her drugged
stupor—she was too weak for them to drug her heavily—she
stirred and whimpered if her cousin went from
her. Two nurses were installed, but only from Ivy would
the stricken mite take mixture or suffer touch. She
looked at her father with hard, hurt eyes; she scarcely
noticed her mother; she turned her face from the
kindly doctors; hated the nurses, and said so; and it
must have gone hard with Ivy for a snatch of food and
rest, had Blanche not taken a sudden fancy to Kow Li.
She screamed if Ivy moved from her side, unless Kow
Li took the cousin’s place. She even fretted after a
short half-hour and called for Ivy; and when she did,
the girl always came. But, thanks to Kow Li, Miss
Gilbert did get half-hour snatches of rest in the next
room: Sên King-lo’s living room, his Chinese books
about it, traces of him everywhere, and as much an atmosphere
of China as if it had been in Pekin. Why that
was so would be hard to say, but it was. Almost all
the sparse furnishing was Western: easy-chairs and
chesterfield, many books, and water-colors mostly English.
There were no bamboos, pictured or real—not a
dragon nor a joss-stick. But the room breathed China,
and a girl’s sensitiveness caught it, as only one visitor
had before: Sir Charles. And he had lived in China.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the first frightened hour’s absorption she had
realized poignantly that these were Mr. Sên’s rooms—the
intimate place of his being and keeping, as true
of him and as redolent of him as Rosehill was of Miss
Julia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia slept on a large and very elaborate bed;
Sên King-lo slept on one that could not comfortably
have been narrower, so narrow that even wee, ill
Blanche was not lost in it, and so Spartan-plain that
its new occupant considered it “horrid shabby,” and
said so the first day she was well enough to take the
slightest interest in anything but her own aching body.
Miss Julia’s bedroom walls were covered with portraits,
all but one of dead and gone Townsends, many as
babies, two in their coffins: daguerreotypes, pastels, oils,
water-colors, photographs, plain and colored; the one
other, the largest and most handsomely framed, a portrait
of Robert E. Lee in Confederate uniform. Only
one picture hung on Sên King-lo’s bedroom walls—Kwan
Yin-ko. And, under the doctors and Ivy herself, that
Chinese Holy Mother of Mercy wrought the loving
miracle of the English baby’s recovery. For Kwan
Yin-ko caught the child’s roving eye almost at once and
riveted it. The nurses thought it a horrible picture, and
the night nurse, who had been scrupulously well brought
up in Bangor, Maine, disliked being in the room with
the ugly heathenish thing. But Blanche pronounced
it a most beautiful lady, and Kow Li owed half his firm
place in the small invalid’s heart to the skilful stories
he told her of Kwan Yin-ko—and a weird jumble of
mythology, fairy-tales and pure lie he made them! But
they gave the English child infinite delight, and Ivy Gilbert
many a refreshing half-hour of sleep out in the
next room on Sên King-lo’s sofa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên himself slept now at his own Legation and at
the Snows’. Sir Charles and his wife came and went,
and so did Sên King-lo; but Ivy lived in Sên’s rooms—while
Blanche stayed there. Emma Snow had begged
to share Ivy’s care of the child; but her grief and
anxiety made her too tearful for medical approval,
and the doctors limited her comings, and the nurses
speeded her departures, while Blanche, with baby ruthlessness,
made it clear that it was “mine own Nivy”
she wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurses had a sinecure. Miss Gilbert and yellow
Kow Li usurped their office. In less than a week the
night nurse and the Chinese Goddess parted company,
and the day nurse went out more and more and knew
well enough that she was there for a social reason,
and as a fall-back-on, should the need occur, but that
Ivy was in charge. And being a sensible girl, born
and bred in New York and well paid, the day nurse
did not care in the least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their small encounter with half-tipsy Reginald Hamilton
had marked an advance in the comradeship of the
Chinese man and the English girl. It had so impelled
Ivy more than it did Sên—naturally. The accident to
the children drew both to a stronger liking, and Sên to a
new understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had saved the two little lives, there was no
question of that—Charles and Emma knew it and
said it, and so did two physicians and three policemen,
and the newspapers underlined it. And Ivy had seen
him do it. He had had to wear his left arm in a sling
for a day or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had seen his strength again—no doubt now about
those delicate hands of his—but she had seen something
of that before, and his courage and cool-headed resource
had not surprised her. To her it had seemed
as much a matter of course that he had proved brave
and clear-witted as it had to him to swing tipsy insolence
down to the snowy roadway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But <span class='it'>he</span> had seen a new woman, a new womanliness.
He had seen the love as well as the pain on her face
as she had bent down to the mangled baby out there
under his window, and had gathered it up into her
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They two had been alone with the injured children
a long quarter of an hour that had seemed longer, before
the doctor had come, or even Kow Li, who had gone on
an errand. Both had some skill at “first aid”—he much
more than her—and he had seen the grit with which she
had held the broken arm in place while he did the little
he could for the crushed little leg; had seen the tenderness
and strength with which she had soothed and controlled
the pain-and-fright-broken mite; and had known
that Ivy Gilbert’s “flaw” had been the unjust creation
of his own crass stupidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chinese omniscience has its human limits. Sên
King-lo had learned that a woman is not necessarily unwomanly,
or unloving of little children because she has
little flair for blindman’s-buff and leap-frog, and even
less for “I am, thou art, he is” and “three times three
is nine.”</p>

<h1 id='t7351'>CHAPTER XXVIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Sên let himself in quietly; the doctors forbade knocking
or ringing—Blanche <span class='it'>might</span> be asleep. His sitting-room
door was open, and he glanced in cautiously
as he stood in the hall, a little shyly—in case a girl dozed
or lay on the chesterfield. Lady Snow had asked him
to call here for her at three, and it was just on three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one was in the sitting-room. There was not a
sound in the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Lady Snow had succeeded in taking Miss Gilbert
out for an hour, as she’d told him she was going to try
to do. And only Kow Li was in there with Blanche,
who must be sleeping, because she wasn’t talking and
neither was Kow Li.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door into the bedroom, his own room—but
Blanche’s now—also was wide open. Sên tiptoed to it.
He’d take a peep at the sleeping baby and beckon Kow
Li out, if she hadn’t clutch-hold of his hands or his
sleeve as she so often had. Sên rather thought he’d
have to give Kow Li to Blanche next Christmas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo paused at the sill of his bedroom door,
rooted there by a force he never had felt before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He <span class='it'>knew</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baby Blanche was fast asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ivy was not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knelt by the bed, all the sweetness of girlhood
unspoiled, all the motherhood-love in the face she bent
over the child that slept in her cradling arms, baby head
on maiden breast. And Kwan Yin-ko up on the wall,
was guarding them both.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>And Sên King-lo knew.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A great light came into his eyes. A sudden beat under
his ribs made a vein on his forehead swell and throb,
quivered his lips; and all his being rushed to the kneeling
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As quietly as he had come in, he turned and went, and
went from the house, an up-to-date Washington flat that
was a sanctuary now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew his own secret now, knew it as completely
and as surely as he had learned it suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nature had torn a veil aside, and a man had looked in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had seen his own soul, and he knew that if ever
life gave him a child—a girl-child, perhaps, to bear his
mother’s name—he but now had seen its mother—an
English girl kneeling beside his bed.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>He walked away from the city, taking his course to the
woods across the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew the bar—the impossibilities—the disaster
and petty, sore frets that passionate disobedience must
bring. He knew and believed all this as no untraveled
girl could. To call a halt to her heart Ivy had only
instinct and a convention for which she had lost respect—had
lost it because of what she had found in him.
He had conviction, China, thousands of years. The bar
that she had come to think but inconvenience and problem,
a drawbridge of race that <span class='it'>might</span>—were the motive
enough—be lowered or raised, was to him an impenetrable,
unsurmountable wall—the Greater Wall of China,
with never a breach or loophole in its everlasting imperial
masonry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If ever his puissant, virile manhood—the wholesomeness
and sweetness of his being—the heritage his fathers
had given—pulsed to manhood’s gravest sacrament,
life’s perfect fulfilment, he had seen today—there in
his room, the mate of his being, the core of his soul,
his children’s mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>And she was forbidden.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Did she suspect?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could he have taught her to care? English Ruby!
<span class='it'>English!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>What</span> was he going to do about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elenore Ray could have told him.</p>

<h1 id='t7453'>CHAPTER XXIX</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo gave a cry; a thousand words could
not have said more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy and he had lunched at Miss Julia’s—blind Miss
Julia—and were walking home through the woods, at
least as far as the river. They might find a cab near
the bridge, or, if not, they could take a street-car there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here in the quiet old wood where two months ago
he had brought his new revelation, to be alone with it,
to creep into Nature’s rest, to lift his eyes to the sky
and the darkling hills, to cool his burn and still his
soul amid the trees where now buds swelled and hidden
sap lifted, to wash and clean his hands and his spirit
in the crisp air that whispered of summer—they loitered
a time because it was so beautiful here, and because they
were together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>June flowers grew in the grass; a beryl and cinnabar
sky crowned and mantled the world. The trees were
heavy and big with leaf, grave and gay with a score
of greens. Bees hummed to the wild roses. An old
apple-tree, late but lusty of blossoms, buffeted and bent
by a thousand gales—but its good roots held—lay prone
on the ground. Its flowers lay a perfumed white and
rose veil heaped on ferns and hare-bells. A baby squirrel
sat bolt up on the prostrate gnarled trunk, industriously
washing his baby face. The summer air had
a score of scents and bore on its fragrant warmth one
message. And married birds were teaching their babies
to fly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They ought not to have come here—the man and the
girl who had grappled their wills to renouncement—not
here to this perfumed place of fulfilment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was here that Sên King-lo had brought his new
joy and sorrow one late afternoon in April—had sat
an hour where the cleanly squirrel sat now, and had
fought his first round in his battle with self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had made up mind and purpose then in the only
way he could. Marriage between him—Chinese—and
an English girl, even if he could win her to it, which
he believed he could not—must not be; should not. And
from that he never had wavered, did not waver now.
He had thought it all out bit by bit and had made his
paramount resolve, and little by little the plan of his
nearer days. Since he might not ask what he most
craved, he would hold but the faster, while he might,
to what he already had: friendship and sweet welling
companionship. He never could marry; it was written;
and because it was, he would garner every dear memory
he could to comfort his years. But again and again
the dream came of an English Ruby sitting in firelight
and garden—<span class='it'>his</span> firelight, <span class='it'>his</span> garden—while his eyes
played with her hair. He knew it a dream. He would
not, if he could, have it a fact. But he knew he would
keep it forever and dream it again and again while his
years lasted. Take it home with him some day and
dream it again when he sat a childless old man on the
banks of the Yellow Sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They ought not to have come here or lingered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo knew his own strength; but, Chinese
though he was, he did not know Nature’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a ripping old hero,” he said, pointing down
to the prostrate tree, “game to the last.” He gathered
her a spray of the rosy apple-blossoms and buds and
filched for his coat another. “We must come here—in
September. The apples that grow on so brave a
tree should be good—full of tang, like wine. We’ll eat
them in September. It’s a bargain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am going home in August,” she told him and
added lightly, though her lips felt stiff, “Didn’t you
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo gave a cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their eyes met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was neither China nor England—nor Virginia.
There was only a man and a girl—and Nature: in all
the world nothing else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not go—from me,” he said. “I cannot
live without you. You are my life.” He held his arms
out to her with a gesture that pleaded—but claimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy took a step towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo did the rest. He wrapped his arms and
his love about her. He laid his face on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he whispered words in her ear—Chinese
words. She knew none of them—but she did not hear
them as strange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cupped her face in his hands and put it from him
a little, that he might learn it again, that his eyes might
speak his love to her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And her eyes did not falter. They took what he
gave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come <span class='it'>home</span>—with me—some day—to
China?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the end of the world,” she told him. She had
not spoken before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he took her back into love’s tender, reverent
crushing, his face against her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was neither England nor China, nor Virginia:
there was only Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gray cloud darkened the beryl and cinnabar sky.
The Potomac ran colder.</p>

<h1 id='t7582'>CHAPTER XXX</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Washington was delighted; so were the papers—and
proclaimed it. Things were a little dull
in newspaperdom just now, and the Anglo-Chinese engagement
was a savory tit-bit capable of being served up
in a number of ways, and was. Dick and Blanche were
in an ecstasy, and girls Ivy scarcely knew touted shamelessly
to be her bridesmaids. Every one was surprised,
which made it all the more exciting. Every one, with
only three exceptions: Lady Snow, Dr. Ray and Kow
Li. Even Emma Snow was a little surprised, but not
so the Chicago physician and Sên’s Chinese manservant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been expected long ago; but it had hung fire
so long that Washington society had quite made up its
mind that there was nothing in it beyond a friendship
too long-drawn-out and too serene to have even the zest
of flirtation, and Lady Snow herself had come to lean
to that opinion now and then. Until a June day and
an old apple-tree had rent the veil, Sên and Ivy had kept
their mutual secret so well from each other that it was
scarcely surprising that they had balked others of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not many in Washington approved, but most were
pleased—a very different thing—and the papers were
honestly grateful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came with all the toothsome surprise of an unforeseen
sensation. And the wedding would be great fun.
Would they be married at the Church of the Ascension?
Was Sên King-lo a Christian? Nobody seemed to know.
Or would they take Convention Hall or the Lafayette
Square Opera House and be married on the stage with
Chinese rites by Chinese priests, with posture girls at
the back and tom-toms in the orchestra, and fire-crackers
for confetti? What fun!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truck-loads of Chinese junk, real and imitation,
poured in on Ivy from mere acquaintances, and from a
number whom she had not met, but was going to meet
now—if <span class='it'>they</span> could contrive it. Lucille Smith sat on
the doorstep, and for days Ivy had to stay indoors to
avoid reporters and camera men—even the back-door
and the tradesmen’s gate were “watched”—and Sên
King-lo was photographed every time he came to see
his fiancée, which was often.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the four hundred and the outer thousand were
pleased and palate-tickled, a handful of others, and they
more nearly interested, were not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia Calhoun Townsend was ill with rage and disgust.
Charles Snow was anxious and bitterly anxious
too. The Chinese Minister didn’t like it, but told no
one so. Kow Li didn’t like it at all, but only told an
opium pipe—a very harmless opium-pipe. Uncle Lysander
was enormously shocked and disgusted, and he
lost no time and spared no pains in noising it abroad
that he was. Elenore Ray and Emma Snow stood by
Ivy, and the little they said to outsiders was in approval;
but at heart neither approved, and each was sorry,
Lady Snow the more so and the more acutely. With
Elenore Ray an eager scientific and psychological interest
somewhat dulled her personal and friendly anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia Townsend writhed. She closed her doors to Sên
King-lo and to Miss Gilbert and told them so in frigidly
phrased notes written in the third person. A week later
she sent for them both—separately—and pleaded and
argued. She stormed and wept at Sên King-lo. Ivy
came in for most of the pleading, though Sên had his
share, and it was to Ivy that she said the hardest and
the more questionable things, for she could not quite
break the reticence of generations in speaking of intimate
things to any man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia quarreled with Dr. Ray because Elenore
Ray would not altogether condemn or at all ostracize,
and Sir Charles Snow very nearly quarreled with his
wife—and that he did not quite do so was Emma’s fault,
not his. He was wretchedly unhappy about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia hurt Ivy a little and angered her bitterly—but
accomplished nothing, lost a friendship and didn’t
score a point. Sên King-lo she did not anger at all;
venomous speech is a Chinese privilege of old age and
of women—and Sên King-lo valued her words, not for
what they said, but for the kindness that he knew had
forced her to speak them; he remembered all her gracious
motherliness of years to him, the exquisite, pathetic
motherliness of child-deprived and aging spinsterhood.
He was neither hurt nor angered, and his gratitude and
his affection held. But some of her words and the truth
they spoke troubled him. He could not brush them aside,
and he could not forget them. Sên King-lo knew the
risk he was taking—far better than Miss Julia could.
She guessed it a little, spurred by prejudice to state it
sourly. He knew it; both his intelligence and his honesty
acknowledged it; his courage accepted it. He accepted
it, gladly even, now for himself. But—for Ivy? Was
the risk he was going to let her take too cruel, too close
a risk? Such a marriage would have its pricks, and
sometimes its scourge. He had no doubt of that. Could
he keep every prick and scourge for him alone, keep
them <span class='it'>all</span> from her? He said “Goodbye” to Miss Julia
as affectionately as she would permit, more sadly than
he would show. And his heart had a heavy ache as the
door of Rosehill closed behind him forever, and he went
through Rosehill’s gate for the last time.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Every</span> goodbye has its tinge of sadness. We know the
ills we have; not the ills to come. The released prisoner
throws a long last look at his gaol as the warder locks him
<span class='it'>out</span>. To say goodbye to old friendship, old kindness, old
welcome is hard and sad indeed. It cuts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles took it harder than Julia Townsend did
but attacked it more gravely and kindly, more gently.
But he did his utmost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Emma his wife he showed his rancor and a little
his tingling spleen. He went among his colleagues
grimly. But to Sên King-lo he showed only his sorrow
and anxiety and his friendship, and even more considerately
to Ivy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke to her with his hand on hers; but for all his
cousinly kindness and all his diplomatic care, he angered
her even more than he hurt—and he hurt. And he
failed. He had expected to fail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he hoped not to fail with Sên King-lo.</p>

<h1 id='t7722'>CHAPTER XXXI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>They argued it long and carefully—not once hotly—not
once either failing in courtesy or affection.
That was impossible because their mutual respect and
affection was too well founded and seasoned—too deep
and sincere. But no hint of rancor or unfairness on
one part, or suspicion of it on the other, made Snow’s
position and arguments the stronger and perhaps did
not weaken either Sên’s attitude or his reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no “quarrel-scene” about it, only regret
on both sides, by both frankly acknowledged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dislike it,” Sir Charles began, passing his cigarettes—tobacco
marks conference, not dispute—“I dread it
utterly, and I ask you to consider it searchingly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I have done that, Sir Charles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Since</span>, I’ll be bound,” Snow continued, “for I’m
convinced that you’d not have done it—spoken. I mean—if
you had thought it out beforehand. It came on
impulse, I suspect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite on impulse,” the other owned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It usually does,” Sir Charles Snow smiled as he
sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I had considered it from every angle, I think,
<span class='it'>before</span>, as I also have since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you did not mean to speak?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant not to speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you did; and now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly did,” Sên assented. “It was no speaking
of Miss Gilbert’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both men smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, Sên?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dislike it too,” Sên said quietly, “in some of its
aspects.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I dread it a little for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have more cause to dread it for yourself,” the
other said sharply. “Given considerable luck Ivy may
go through it practically scot free. But for you, as I
see it, it can be nothing but disaster. She <span class='it'>may</span> get
through it comfortably enough—if she never goes
East—” Sên winced a little and his eyes were grave—“but
if you persist in it, you are running your head very
tightly into a very rough noose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll risk that,” Sên’s eyes were smiling again, “and
because I believe I can keep it from being sometimes an
inconvenience to her, I do persist in it, Sir Charles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it fair to her to persist in what you own you
dislike?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of its possible rasps—probable rasps—only,
and between which and her I believe that I can always
stand. I intend to. And I like it,” Sên added, “incomparably
more than I dislike—know and admit that I
should dislike—one or two of its quite possible consequences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite possible,” Snow repeated with quiet significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like it immensely, Sir,” Sên said with a boyish
laugh but a man’s steady purpose and pride in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you fear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, scarcely fear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear it,” Snow insisted. “Take the way out. I beg
you to—for both your sakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no way out,” Sên King-lo declared, “none
that I can take, or will. If your cousin—you have spoken
to her, of course, or will——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have spoken to Ivy,” Snow told him grimly, “and
made matters worse, if I did anything. She’ll not budge
an inch. But you—you are reasonable. You will listen
to what I have to say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To every word of it and as long as you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow plunged into his arguments—most of them the
old ones that every student of “East and West” has
heard again and again, and that dozens of pens have
twisted and turned into well-grimed shreds. And, quite
without offensiveness, he cut very much deeper into
physical things—revulsions, apparent, if not actual,
abnormality, and so on—than often a pen has dared to
do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In some points, Sên agreed; most he rejected or
claimed to be outweighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw it as you do, on the whole—until—the other
day,” he admitted; “but I see it differently now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would,” Sir Charles said with a smile that was
grim but patient and not unkind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not know—not until a short time ago—how it
was with me. It took me quite by surprise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It frequently does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was a dunce, of course, not to know where I was
drifting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We always are——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when I found out and looked it in the face—I
did do that—I firmly determined to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut it out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, just that! And then—the other day——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ran you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên nodded. “And now,” he added, his face radiant,
“I cannot give Ruby up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or think you can’t,” Snow insinuated. “So you
call her Ruby! I like it best, and it suits her too. There
is not much of the clinging vine about her, I think, and
I assure you there was none at all yesterday when I
attempted to say to her less than a tenth of what I have
said to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên laughed—rather proudly. Sir Charles Snow’s
affectionate smile was grimmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I’ve filched your own name for her,” Sên
King-lo said. “I too think it suits her the better, and
it’s the name I’ve always cared for most—it was my
mother’s name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove!” Snow murmured, and added under his
breath, “I’d forgotten that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo looked up in amazement from the match
he was striking, and his eyes were not pleased. How
came this Englishman to have heard that? A Chinese
gentleman does not name his wife to another man—and
in China her children may not speak it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They smoked on in silence. Sir Charles was musing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a Christian?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” the Chinese told him, “though I was confirmed
at Public School—they made it part of the ‘course,’
as they did cricket and footer—and I took it all as part
of the ‘English’ I was there to learn.” He added, but
with absolute courtesy, “Are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe in God,” Snow said stoutly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not in our God, not in hers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I do,” Sên King-lo assented. “I believe that
there is only one God—many gods, but only one God.
Does it matter what we call him? I think not. Or matter
how we reach him? I can’t believe it. And, on my soul,
I don’t believe that there is much difference between any
two religions that are both sincere and devout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you say that in China?” Snow demanded
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” Sên King-lo replied, “if I had any reason
to do so, to any one who had the right to ask. There
still are parts of China, of course, in which it wouldn’t
be altogether safe to whisper it even—not for a Chinese
to do so—and in them I should not go out of my way to
megaphone it. We have not, as it happens, spoken
together about religion—Miss Gilbert and I; but I shall
not try to convert her to any one of our old Chinese
religions. I can promise you that. And they are crumbling
fast. Christianity’s the coming religion of China.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” Sên persisted. “And why not? It is an
Oriental faith—as every great faith has been and is—from
Zoroastrianism to Christian Science—Spiritualism
thrown in, if you like, and the faith of the Friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Admitted. Well, I won’t pretend to think that
religious difference is the principal bar. But tell me
this, Sên: had your mother been living, would you have
asked my cousin to be your wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” the other answered promptly. “I would not
hurt my mother or deceive her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you take an English wife to China?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—I’ve thought that out, and I would not—not
yet at least. The time is not ripe—but it’s coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I intended to live my life out in China. Even the
other day, I asked her if she would let me take her
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t tell me what she answered. I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’d go like a shot and be infernally miserable after
she had. The East is paradise for European women,
unless they are married to Eastern men, and then it is
hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely. And that is why I shall not go back to
China.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You always have wished to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Intensely. But everything is changed now. A man’s
work must go on, of course——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It should,” Snow interjected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I may need to make flying visits now and then—sure
to, I think—but she shall not come. England shall
be our home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be a sacrifice,” Sir Charles began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But I shall be glad to make it. I intend to
make them all. And they’ll not cost me much—for that
matter. They can’t, for—she is all the world to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles Snow knew better than that. But he knew
that Sên King-lo meant it, and he let it pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you thought of your children? Yours and
hers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Desperately hard,” Sên answered, gravely. Snow
had drawn blood at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be worse for them than for her or for you,”
he urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be, in China,” Sên agreed sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damnable!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our children shall be English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half-English,” the other reminded him, “<span class='it'>Eurasians!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo flushed a little. His Chinese soul winced
at that word. Snow had meant that it should. But he
was sorry to thrust so at Sên King-lo, here in the room—Snow’s
own room—where they had smoked so many
“peace-pipes” and held such intimate and cordial
conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles Snow saw that the other’s face was troubled
now, but he saw no receding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment he rose and unlocked a drawer in a
tall cabinet—the only Chinese thing in the room—and
came back with a small oval thing in his hand. “No one
but I ever has looked at it,” he said with one hand on
Sên King-lo’s shoulder, “since the day it was given to
me.” And he laid the miniature down at Sên’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo saw the face of a very beautiful Chinese
girl painted on the oval of ivory, and painful color
crimsoned his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother,” he said huskily. For an instant his
eyes were enraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” the Englishman replied quietly, going back to
his chair, leaving the miniature on the smoking-table
between them. “Your mother’s sister. Her milk-name
was ‘Lotus.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The nun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was not a nun when I knew her,” Charles Snow
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen your mother, too, Sên King-lo,” he added
presently, “both as a girl in her father’s home and as a
wife in her husband’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw her!” Sên Ruby’s son said sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were very alike—the sisters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very,” Sên agreed. “I have a miniature of my
mother, here in my rooms, that might almost be this.
My father gave it to me, from his robe, as he died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were painted by the same brush,” Snow told
him. “I have seen <span class='it'>your</span> miniature, Sên King-lo. Their
father trusted me, and so did yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên gave his English friend a filial look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to tell you the story. I thought it was
shut away in my own keeping forever, but I am going
to tell it to you—now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’d rather not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d much rather not. But I must. I am going to
tell you what I’d far rather keep an old locked sweetness—a
far away thing, but my own—going to tell it in my
final attempt to save you and my cousin from the hideous
mistake and life-long misery from which your grandfather
saved me and his daughter years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two children’s voices in happy clamor rang out in
the hall, and their mother’s voice joined in, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have loved but two women, desired but two, in all
my life, Sên King-lo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, only one,” the Chinese said gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are young,” the older man told him, gently, a
kindly twinkle in his blue eyes. “I love my wife very
dearly, Sên——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that, sir.” And he knew also that, whatever
this unexpected story which Charles Snow was about to
entrust to him, there was no discredit in it—a perfumed
breath of the long-ago, no slightest stench of any time
or place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles Snow told it slowly—pausing again and
again—striking a match, drawing a whiff of smoke from
his cigarette. It is not easy for Englishmen to tell such
stories at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The second year I was in China, I spent two months
in a monastery that lay on the edge of your grandfather’s
place—a friend or two with me for part of the time,
for the rest alone. The monks had an excellent cook—or
one of them was—and a good bottle or two. They, good
men, were no sour zealots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came and went as I would and did as I liked. It
was liberty-hall for me, that old monk-kept inn, in the
pines on the hill. There were no other guests. It was
rest and peace and relaxation—perfect that—until I held
a Chinese girl in my arms. Yes, King-lo, I have held a
Chinese nun in my arms—and,” a queer, tender smile
in his grave eyes, “your mother, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sên King-lo only smiled back with a tranquil face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One afternoon I was squatted with a book at the
edge of the pines, nearer your grandfather’s house than
I was to the monastery, reading a little, doing nothing
most of the time—<span class='it'>being</span>, not doing at all. The sun was
setting—I can see it now. Looking up from a page—it
was Han Yu, by the way—I saw a plume of flame lick
up from the low, widespread, red-roofed house, and then—the
day was very still—I heard a girl cry. You know
what things of old wood most Chinese houses are, and
how they burn if once they start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên nodded. He knew. All China knows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ran, of course—no ceremony then between me and
the devil-guards on a Chinese man’s forbidden gate. I
pelted in and I carried two Chinese girls out—they
didn’t weigh much, the pair of them. They were very
like their pictures.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The servants ran about like
tipsy rabbits and were of no possible use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên nodded again. He found that easy to believe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It turned out that all the men of the family were
miles away—hunting. And my idea of what was best to
do with those two little things in my arms was—well,
hazy. I didn’t speak Chinese then quite as well as I
did afterwards, and the gibbering servants knew no
Mandarin. At least, if they did, they didn’t trot it out
then, and their language was completely new to me. I
didn’t quite know what to do with those girls. One
giggled—your mother—” Sên smiled—“the other cried.
Ivy’s laugh has reminded me of your mother’s sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên looked at him curiously, but Snow did not bite his
lip—propaganda forgotten—for he and his cigarette
were far away, living again an old love-story. A song of
Grieg’s came from the drawing-room. It was Ivy’s
touch, Sên King-lo knew, but Charles Snow did not hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So—I took them to the monastery. There was a small
consternation, but the top monk cleared out of his cell,
heaped it with the best things in the place—rugs and
cushions and things—and there they slept. Their women
were with them, and some score of the men servants and
coolies jabbering and smoking outside, while I did sentry-go
outside the cell door, and the fraternity told their
rosaries and chanted their prayers half through the
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We lived there for four or five weeks—all of us,
your grandfather and his four sons—a runner found
them the next day, and they came hot-haste. The service
I’d done wasn’t much, just carrying two little things
kitten-light, and not much more than kitten-big, from
under a roof that was blazing to one that wasn’t—nothing
but that and keeping my head while a gang of ‘the
babies,’ as your people call their retainers, completely
lost theirs; but the father made a mountain of it Omi-high.
Chinese gratitude is gigantic—always. We lived
there together as one family, I as free of the two girls
as their brothers were, and when a new house was run
up near where the other had been—your grandfather
made ‘the babies’ work like Egyptian slaves—he made
me welcome there, and I was as free to go into the
‘flowery’ courtyard and garden as their own brothers
were; and I did so very much oftener than they did.
He could not have allowed any Chinese man what he
allowed me. He held that the race-bar put me as much
out of personal bounds—as far as his daughters were
concerned—as if I’d been the man in the moon. They
might have married a vase or a man dead and cremated;
but they could not marry an Englishman, and the
thought of such a thing could never arise. He was right,
and he was wrong. So I stayed at the mandarin’s home
rather more than I did at the monastery—sat in the
courtyard with the tulips and musk while Lotus
tweaked her lute and Ruby sorted her silks and ‘pulled
the flowers up’ in the silk on her loom. They were very
alike—so alike that some of the servants, and the brother
who saw them least often, could not always tell them
apart; but I always could. The lady Ruby had the
prettier laugh—a tinkle of silver bells—carried her
head the prouder; Lotus had the softer eyes, her hands
were a shade the tinier, her mouth had the longer
bow—and I had touched her hand by chance, as it lay
on my coat the time of the fire, and once again when
we’d reached on one impulse to gather narcissus that
grew by the brook where the monks caught their breakfast
trout. I learned more Chinese in those four weeks
than I’d learned in two years.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The usual thing
happened—to both of us. It was a dream—a courtyard
madness. But I planned to keep it. And one day, by
the lily-pond, I touched her hand again and told her.
And her eyes answered me until they fell from mine,
and then their lids answered me—they were trembling,
and her fingers fluttered and answered me too. I knew
that I should never return to England but stay always
in China.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When I told her father—I went and
found him and told him then, leaving her alone there by
the lily-pool.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I never saw her again. When I told
him, his amazement was terrible. He was kind—very
kind. But he convinced me. He shattered my dream.
He showed me the thing I contemplated as the monstrous
impossibility it was. In my reason, I think, I
thanked him even then. He saved two lives from misery
and lasting regrets. I know it now. And I never look
on my children or hear them at play that I do not
thank him. I left Pechilli that same day. And I never
have been there again. Two years later when she
‘took the veil’—I forget what it’s called in China—she
wrote me a letter—her last day at home—out in the
courtyard—a little red letter. Your grandfather gave
it to me in Pekin. I have it still. I have not looked
at it for years, but I have kept it. I do not know if
she lives——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” King-lo said softly—there were tears in his
eyes—“an abbess, happy and loved. I saw my aunt the
last time I was at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. I am glad to know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And your
grandfather gave me that miniature. A great portrait-painter—the
greatest of that day—a woman—had
painted it and one of her sister for him, and they were
among the few things that were not burned. An old
blind servant had had the wit to snatch them, as he
ran, knowing how his master valued them. This is
the one your grandfather gave me. The other you
have—I have no doubt it is it. Your father showed
it to me. After your mother’s marriage, being in
Ho-nan, I called on your father—your grandfather
had asked me to do it. Sên Wo T’ring made me very
welcome, and took me at once to your mother where
she sat in her courtyard, working flowers on a tiny
coat—her women about her. She sent them away and
presently he left us—alone. I was there for an hour,
and she gave me her hand and a rose for my coat—I’m
afraid I haven’t it now—when your father went with
me to the outer gate. He was a very gracious gentleman,
your father, Sên King-lo. But he would not have taken
me into his wife’s courtyard if I had been Chinese—or
your mother have given me her hand and a flower.
You were born, the next week. I never saw Sên Ruby
again. But Sên Wo T’ring I saw often. Because of
what your grandfather had told him, because I had
carried your mother from a house that was burning,
and, I think, because Sên Ruby had asked it, he held
me his friend. And I held him mine and valued it
greatly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I want to stand his friend today, and hers,
and yours. Sên King-lo, for the love of the dead, for the
sake of the unborn, and in pity of them—give it up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry,” Sên King-lo said earnestly; but his
face was set firm, and Sir Charles Snow knew that he
had failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we ask Lady Snow to give us some tea now?”
was all he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not today, thanks very much,” was Sên’s answer.
And they parted then with a grip of their hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles Snow sat for a long time with the old
miniature in his hand. Then he locked it away and
went to romp with his children and chat with his wife
until the dressing-bell rang.</p>

<h1 id='t8278'>CHAPTER XXXII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles had meant well, and so had Miss
Julia; but the result of their united effort was
that they hastened it on. It has happened before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Ivy herself who, though she did not directly
say it, showed Sên clearly that she wished it so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was unhappy at her cousin’s. Emma Snow was
all that was kindest. But Sir Charles could not hide
his displeasure and the something too of shame that he
felt. He did not blame Sên King-lo as much as he
felt that he ought. He saw great excuse for Sên King-lo—for
his impulse, if not for his stubborn persistence.
Men loved. It came and it went. But it had to come.
Shut off from his own people, debarred from the women
of his race, it was inevitable that his manhood should
turn to some one of the women among whom he lived.
And Sir Charles appreciated what Ivy’s appeal and lure
had been—appreciated it all. Desdemona, on the stage,
usually is golden-haired and tea-rose faced. A finer art
would show her Venetian dark. Sir Charles heard the
Chinese note in Ivy’s laugh and knew that the colors
she oftenest wore and the dangling things she instinctively
thrust in dress and hair had a Chinese touch—and
how that must be in Sên King-lo’s eyes. Although she
did not know a <span class='it'>taotai</span> from a <span class='it'>compradore</span>, a <span class='it'>hong</span> from
a <span class='it'>pai’fang</span> or a <span class='it'>k’o-tang</span>, a <span class='it'>tong</span> from a <span class='it'>yamên</span>, yet he
now and then heard a Chinese sentiment from her
English lips, caught a Chinese trend and bias in her
mind. Her sensitiveness was as Chinese as it was
girlish. Her love of flowers and that she liked one or
two or a spray far more than she did a mass of them,
her fondness for stringed-instruments—the harp was
more to her than the piano or organ—her interest in
handwritings, and a dozen traits, small enough singly,
were not unlike those of the Chinese. Her horror of
debt—he never had known her to owe a farthing—her
pride and her quick sense of humor were more general
in China than they were in England. He could understand
Sên’s madness, even while he steeled his soul not
to condone it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he saw no excuse for Ivy. To him she seemed
the victim of wilful and headstrong infatuation. Sên
King-lo was a rich man, and Snow partly realized how
the girl loathed her poverty. But he was just enough
to know that in this she had given dollars and cents
no thought. And there were rich men and to spare
here in Washington and at home in England—and
Ivy had beauty, personality and charm. Of course
she wished—whether she knew so or not—to marry.
Every nice girl did—and should. But an English girl
as nice as he had believed his cousin to be would have
lived forever unwedded and childless, rather than marry
an Oriental. He had not forgotten Lotus; but he had
been a boy then, and she not much more than a child
who never had seen a man of her caste but not of her
blood—until she had looked up from his arms into his
face. And, too, that had been very different—love’s
young dream in a lotus-garden, the dream that all
Nature and strange circumstances had conspired to
make it. And he had had the sound sense and the stern
British good taste to renounce it. And it had been a
long time ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy had lost caste with her cousin. And, in spite
of himself, he showed it. And the girl, sensitive, proud
and dependent, felt it intensely. They had been close
friends, particular chums until now, and now they
were merely a disgusted kinsman and an outraged
kins-girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, too, money was pinching her: the need and
lack of it. Lessons were a thing of the past now. Emma
Snow good-humoredly had insisted upon that and then
regretted that she had, for Ivy flatly refused even a
dime of Charles’ money that she had not so much as
pretended to earn. Her purse was empty, and she
needed new gloves. Emma missed seeing a ring and
a brooch of Ivy’s and suspected that she had sold them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And most of all now the girl longed to get away
from the house in which even her cousin’s bread tasted
bitter. She refused the dishes she liked best, stole many
bits of needlework from Justine, and mutilated almost
her last ten dollars to buy stuff she made into a little
frock that Blanche didn’t need, and counted how many
of the meals she unwillingly ate its shop value would
have paid for. She burned her electric light sparingly,
bought her own stamps and used as few of them as she
could, and walked to save street-car fares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were married in August—Sên King-lo was
eagerly glad to have it so—and Washington society had
no wedding-day treat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were neither bridesmaids nor cake. And they
left Washington in an hour after. Sên King-lo had had
no difficulty in arranging for an official transfer to
London; for the semidiplomatic position he held under
China’s new Republic was elastic, a roaming brief when
he chose, and its itinerary very much at his own discretion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Earlier than social Washington often stirred from
its beds, Sên and Ivy were married in a small quiet
church in a small quiet tree-shaded street. And before
Washington knew of the ceremony Mr. and Mrs. Sên
were on the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo had wished intensely that Sir Charles
Snow should give his cousin away and had urged it,
jealous for her that she should come to her husband
as English girls were accustomed to do. But Snow
<span class='it'>could</span> not, and Ivy would not have allowed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Abraham Kelly, wearing a flopping gray frock-coat
and feeling as if his maiden aunt had caught him
at a game of draw-poker in a churchyard, gave Ivy
away, while the Chinese Minister looked on with a
beam on his face and rage in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No girl-friend was there. Only Emma Snow and Dr.
Ray stood beside her, and, except the clergyman, no one
else was there. There was no music. But for the ruby-red
bud in Sên King-lo’s lounge coat, there was not a
flower, unless the red peppers he himself had bought
at dawn at the market—and that Ivy wore in the little
gray frock that Elenore Ray had given her—counted for
flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were more old clothes than new in Ivy Gilbert’s
trousseau, and those that were new were Dr. Ray’s
gift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Emma the girl would take nothing, for Emma
too had been a penniless bride, and Ivy would accept
nothing for which Charles Snow’s money had paid.
Lady Snow was greatly hurt, but she understood and
forgave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It sounds a sad wedding and a drear one. But the
man and the girl that stood at the altar were radiant-eyed.
Neither had a doubt now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said goodbye in the vestry—the two women
holding Sên King-lo’s wife in their arms lingeringly—and
she and he breakfasted alone in his rooms, to be
dismantled now. Then Mr. and Mrs. Sên caught the
next train for New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They dined alone. Ivy still wore her peppers dangling
in a gown they matched, a red dress which—he had told
her so now—he had thought like the wedding-dress of a
Chinese bride, the night she had given him her confession-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days later they sailed for Liverpool. Mrs. Sên
was glad to go; <span class='it'>she</span> was going home, and New York
had not been entirely comfortable. Washington necessarily
is cosmopolitan and race-seasoned. No one had
looked at her askance when she had walked its streets
beside a Chinese friend or lingered with him in the
Corcoran Gallery—unless the darkies who met them did.
New York was different. Ivy thought that the man who
served their meals was curious, and she had a tingling
sense that the shop-discipline deferential courtesy of
the clerk at Tiffany’s was all for Sên’s purse—less than
none of it for their companionship. She thought that
several passersby on Fifth Avenue looked at them
odiously; twice she saw a lip curl, and once a woman
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not regret Washington. But she was glad
to leave New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voyage was smooth, and her cabin was sweet with
lilies that kept their waxen freshness and their intoxicating
perfume well past-midocean.</p>

<h1 id='t8462'>CHAPTER XXXIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Three years had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All had gone well with Mr. and Mrs. Sên. There
had been tiny rasps, of course; but they had been very
tiny and had gone almost as soon as they had come. And
neither the man nor his wife had had a regret. Sên
had been busy, prosperous and content—keen on his
“job,” proud of his wife, desperately fond of her still.
And, if China had called to him now and then, he had
kept it to himself. Ivy had had three years of happiness
and good times, and she had enjoyed every hour of
it. Her husband had proved the best of long-distance
companions, and his intimate charm had even increased
with their days. London society, the grave and best,
as well as the gay, had given them both cordial welcome,
with never a shrug or the breath of a slur. Sên
King-lo had a very long purse now, and he took a still
boyish delight in having his beautiful wife dip into
it. There was no question now of needed new gloves
or homemade blouses and jumpers for young Mrs. Sên.
They met great folk on a parity. Ruben, their baby,
had his father’s sunny temper and strong self-control,
and though he had his mother’s dark gold-brown eyes,
straight-set, was almost a blonde: an Anglo-Saxon baby,
deliciously and ridiculously fat, great pals with his
father and very much in love with his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had a rambling old house, discreetly modernised,
delightfully furnished, a skilfully “old-world”
garden about it, Kensington High Street not much more
than a stone’s throw away, and a tiny rose-covered crib
on the river. Their love had held and had grown, and
their congeniality and mutual confidence were entire.
Mrs. Sên had left almost her last annoyance on Fifth
Avenue and at Tiffany’s—and only two had come to
her since, both so small that they scarcely are worth
mentioning, even if straws do have a reputed significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the first bewitchery wore off, she discovered that
she disliked her new name—and that it embarrassed
her. And, believing her slightest wish her man’s sacred
law, she suggested modifying and (as she thought,
though she didn’t say it) “civilizing” Sên into “Senn.”
She even went so far on that road as to have visiting
cards engraved “Mrs. K. L. Senn” and handed one
to King-lo as he sat reading in her room after tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is she?” he asked with a smile. “A new
acquaintance or an old one who has found you again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife made him a very low bow. “Behold her!”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He understood on the instant—and he sensed a
chasm ahead, a yawning rent in their future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his face did not change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew his wife down on to his knee, and, with his
face on hers, told her that she might not rename herself
“Mrs. K. L. Senn,” nor anything else. How her wish
to do it had cut him, he did not tell her, and she never
suspected it even. She yielded, but she was vexed
and disappointed. But she put the alias-cards in the
fire and soon forgot all about it, disappointment and
all. But Sên King-lo’s hurt stayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when she saw her name, as he and thousands of
Chinese years had given it to her, engraved on the cards
she ordered the next day, she decided that Sên had a
<span class='it'>chic</span> of its own. (The venerable name, the honorable
name of Sên, <span class='it'>chic</span>!) She grew fond of writing her name
and took special pleasure and pains in making the tent-like
accent and perching it as carefully and daintily
over its “e” as she did a new toque on her beautifully
dressed hair. And she found that its very unusualness
made it a social asset—if a cheap one—in avid London;
and revalued it for this. Her handwriting was as individual
and almost as pretty as she was—and many
more than her husband thought so—and her name as
she wrote it looked particularly well. She always signed
herself “Ruby Sên.” And Sên King-lo never asked
her to write it “Sên Ruby.” But he wished it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other small cloud was a name-cloud, too, and
more permanent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sên did not know what to call her husband.
“King-lo” she did not care for—she thought it had a
heathenish sound, and smacked of Limehouse laundries—though
she had the sweet good taste never to tell
Sên so. “King” by itself she particularly disliked. “It
would be too silly to call you ‘King’ all over the place
when you’re only a Mister. And I won’t call you ‘Sên,’
for you are not a peer.” She tried to invent a name
of her own for him but couldn’t find one. Finally she
called him “Lo” thinking it funny and short and
belittling at first. But she soon forgot that she had,
and Sên thought its sound from her lips the sweetest
sound he’d ever heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And beyond these two Ivy had never felt a shadow
since she sailed from New York City in a jade-colored
green dress that she had worn once at a Rosehill garden
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby could not write its name yet—some five-months-old
babies cannot—and no question had arisen
as yet as to whether that important signature would
be “Ruben Sên” or “Sên Ruben.” Sên King-lo had
named their firstborn, rather insisting on “Ruben” in
place of the “Ruby” he had wished. But he realized
that even a Chinese man—very probably a future great
President—could not appropriately go through life and
international preëminence under the winsome name of
Ruby. But the father liked the sound of “Ruben” better
than the mother did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby—the young mother—enjoyed her social popularity
keenly, and neither she nor Sên suspected that it
had grown even more from the estimate in which several
eminent people held him than from the undeniable
charm of her personality and easy adaptability. She
loved her home, especially the rose-covered crib with only
room for two. She enjoyed her husband’s “vogue” and
his cordial welcome in high places. But most of all she
loved her husband and child—and King-lo the dearer
of the two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one looked at them with unpleasant surprise. London
has an easy grace of the darker strangers within
her imperial gates. And Mrs. Sên soon realized that in
Mayfair there was more distinction than disgrace in
being the English wife of Sên King-lo. And, whatever
they thought or felt about it there, they were very kind
to Mrs. Sên at Portland Place where the five-colors flag
flew. She made his Chinese friends welcome and was
sweetly cordial to them, and most of them liked her.
The Chinese in London grow in numbers, and there
are many of a birth and class that do not affiliate with
Limehouse. But their home and home-life were English.
Kwan Yin-ko hung beside their bed, and an old
Chinese miniature of an older “Ruby” was locked away
in Sên King-lo’s own “den.” But there was nothing
else Chinese in the house. Few smart houses in Hampstead,
Mayfair, Chelsea or Kensington but had more
Chinese curios than the Sêns’ had. It was both kind
and wise of Mr. Sên, many sage folk said. But they
misjudged him there. It <span class='it'>was</span> Sên’s doing, not his English
wife’s; but it was a selfishness—almost his sole
one. He did not wish too many material reminders
about him of the homeland he had forsaken. England
was his home now, and he did not intend ever again to
be homesick for China, and he cut the risks of it as
close as he could. But he still read his own classics,
when he sat alone in his den, and the love-songs of Li-Po.
A man cannot forgo the books that were the mother’s
milk of his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Sên King-lo still brushed many a letter to
friends in Chinese—not all of them business letters.
And he still sometimes played a game of chess with an
opponent in Shansi, and he often heard the Yellow
Sorrow surge and creak—in his dreams as he slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But most of his nights were untroubled and dreamless,
and whatever his sleep, he woke each day to a
deeper and more tender love of the girl who lay beside
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>King-lo always woke the earlier. For centuries his
people had waked at dawn, and the old race-habit stayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When King-lo woke he scarcely stirred lest he disturb
her. Sometimes he drew a book from his bedside table
and kept himself quiet with the volume’s pages till she
moved and he turned to greet her waking. But oftener
Sên King-lo lifted his chin on an elbow-supported hand
and watched and worshiped the girlish loveliness of the
delicate face asleep on its pillow. He thought of the
girl on whose face he had laid his face as they stood by
an old fallen apple-tree, the girl he had taken to wife
one early morning in a crumbling, dreary church, on
an old-fashioned street—a church that had not been
any god-place of his churchless people—in the crown-city
of an alien people, the Queen City of the Potomac.
Though he’d loved the girl well, and had dared to risk
for her the convictions of his being and the future of
all his years, in defiance of the instincts of centuries
and the laws of his fathers, she had not been loved
as he loved his wife resting beside him, sleeping safe
and secure in his love and in the keeping of his manhood.
Day after day Sên King-lo’s soul kept a sacred tryst
with the woman who slept happily there while the sun
came back from China, going its way to China, rose
over New York City, throwing splashes of gold over
skyscrapers, Central Park, boat-busy river, “Flat Iron”
and ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had had many a golden jaunt together—a month
in Venice, wonderful weeks in Spain, again and again
a week in Paris—these married lovers and best of
friends, before Ruben had come to call a halt to their
journeying and make their London life more of a permanency
than it had been. They had learned North
Wales together and watched Windermere. No reasonable
wife could have seriously asked more of marriage
and husband than Sên King-lo had given her. And
riant Mrs. Sên was a very reasonable and entirely contented
woman.</p>

<h1 id='t8679'>CHAPTER XXXIV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>It had worked so well that, when the Snows had come
home a year ago, even Sir Charles had wondered
if Sên King-lo might not prove to have been wiser
than he—if only they stayed in England. He wondered
often now what Sên thought of so English-looking a
son, what he planned for Ruben’s future; but he himself—Sir
Charles—saw some simplification of a vexatious
problem, a sore racial complex, in the baby boy’s Anglo-Saxon
fairness and features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was little that Charles Snow would not have
given or done to have prevented the Sên marriage, and
he still winced at it—English prejudice and preconceptions
are sturdy moral weeds—but as soon as it was
sealed he wished it only well, bent his strength to its
support, and did all he knew to regain the old footing
between his cousin and himself. He wrote to Ivy the
day after her marriage as unforced a letter as he could,
and he wrote several longer, easier letters after she
had reached Europe. But she answered none of them,
and she made no response to any message he sent in
Emma’s friendly and cousinly letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and Sên King-lo exchanged letters, not very frequently,
but always cordially, though not with the verbal
ardor of women. And when he and Lady Snow had
come back to live in London and in the old place in
Kent in which his mother and Ivy’s had been born,
and he walked into his cousin’s drawing-room quite as
if he knew she’d expect and wish him to, and simply
would not be snubbed, she found it impossible to greet
him as coldly as she thought he deserved. And after a
first touch of frigid hauteur which he in perfectly good
humor ignored, she took up their old friendliness, if
not quite their oldtime friendship, again. And she soon
found it easy enough to forgive him, almost to forget.
It’s a mean victor who cherishes venom, and Ivy Sên was
the least mean of women. She and Lo had made good.
Dear old Charlie had written himself down a goose.
Who could be too hard on a goose? Not the happiest,
proudest woman in England. And when she saw the
look in the two men’s eyes as they met, and saw the
affectionate grip of their honest hands, her own eyes
melted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four cousins had dined together at the Sêns’, and
the two women were discussing chiffons and babies and
the sins of chauffeurs over a drawing-room fire—there
were two fires in Ivy’s long drawing-room—and the
men were discussing tobacco, matters of international
import, and a little whiskey in Sên’s den.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As King-lo leaned over the narrow table to refill
the other’s tumbler, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has it? That’s enough soda. What has come?”
But he knew before Sên told him, and Sên told him
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The message from China. They want me at once.
By rights, I should go next week. I haven’t told her
yet. I don’t know how she’ll take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thoroughbred,” Snow replied in a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Superbly. But she won’t like being left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t take her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not. The time isn’t quite ripe, I
think——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles Snow was sure that it was not even
ripening and never would be, but he smoked on in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” King-lo added hurriedly, “I may be wrong
there. But we couldn’t possibly take the young Lord
Ruben home with us yet. <span class='it'>Two</span> messages came by the
same post—this morning’s early one. It isn’t only that
the bank needs me over there for a bit; but my grandmother
tells me to come to her——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil she does,” thought Sir Charles Snow. He
knew those Chinese grandmothers—he knew what their
suzerainty was and the ruthless way they asserted and
enforced it. China might be a republic, but twenty republics
couldn’t clip the wings of one old hobble-gaited
grand-dame who lived, shrill and impregnable, far off
from the tourist-beaten paths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>might</span> do the work at the banks by proxy, important
as it is. But Sên Ya Tin must be obeyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow nodded. He knew that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I couldn’t think of taking the baby <span class='it'>that</span>
journey. You know where we live. I don’t see my
son on that trip! The Yangtze in flood as like as
not, local troubles in at least two of the provinces between
Hongkong and home, shotguns in full action, and
not a cow for miles. No, Sên junior cannot accompany
Sên. I must leave them here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He might or might not leave Sên Ruben, but her
cousin felt sure that he was not destined to leave Mrs.
Sên. But again he kept his opinion to himself. He
had “looked in” on Ivy’s matrimonial affairs for the
last time. It caused friction, and it availed nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish Ivy would come to us then,” was what he
did say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish she would,” Sên replied. “It would be
jolly for her in Kent with you. And splendid for
the boy. But I don’t believe she will. I think she’ll
wish to stay here in our own home and in the cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall you be gone long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard to say. Five or six months, if not longer,
I’m afraid. I must give things a thorough overhauling
at Hongkong. We have a number of ramifications
now, you know—in six of the provinces, and I ought
to go myself to the end of them all. Then it will
take some time to get home and come back from there.
And my grandmother does not say for how long she
will keep me with her—a day or two, perhaps, or it
might be longer—weeks perhaps. I can’t tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles Snow wondered. It might be months
perhaps! The venerable Madame Sên could tell, he
knew; and he knew that she would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’ll tell Ivy as soon as Emma and
I have gone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—in the morning,” Sên replied. “She won’t
like it. I’d hate her to. And I don’t like it myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ll be glad to see China again—to be in
China again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light grew in Sên King-lo’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “I shall be glad to be in China again—for
a time. It hurts to go from this, even for a time.
Ruben will cut a tooth—learn to crawl, perhaps to
stand. And I shall not be here to see it. And—it
means a good deal to me to leave my wife—more than
it will to her—and she won’t like it. But she’ll have
the boy. But I shall be glad to be in China again. I
am glad that I am going back to China, to hear my own
tongue spoken everywhere once more—once I’m well
away from the polyglot treaty ports—to see the birds
I used to know at their breakfast, to eat the old foods
in the old way. I haven’t snapped a melon-seed between
my teeth for years, or seen a mango that <span class='it'>was</span> a mango,
or a lychee that wasn’t a petrified mummy—do you remember
how the lychees taste when the wine of their
ripeness is in them still?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the mangosteens?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only too well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To see only Chinese faces once more—to be among
my countrymen! Oh, I’ve been in exile, and sometimes
I’ve found it bitter—often—until one day Miss Julia
‘gave a party’—and Ruby was there——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles’ face was very grave. He saw writing
on the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo went on with his home-going. “To see
the silk-worms gorging on the mulberry-trees, to see
the red poppies growing—not much use for opium, but
you remember the sea of color they make, lakes and
oceans of it—and the fire-weed—to hear the sound the
mallets make when they strike the bells—the gongs too—in
the old temple courtyards that used to be my
playground when I was a boy—” He broke off and
passed the decanter.</p>

<h1 id='t8872'>CHAPTER XXXV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo did not sleep that night, torn between
two vibrant emotions—sorrow at the impending
separation from his wife and joy to go home again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps Ruby Sên caught in her sleep something of
his double strain, for she woke as the first light filtered
through their loose-drawn curtains; and her waking was
sharp and instant, wide-eyed at once, which it rarely
was. Usually she stirred and dozed, coming back very
gradually to the life of brazened day, as the convolvulus
sleepily unfurls its twisted spiral to the dawn. She
was fast asleep—then, wide awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo turned and took her in his arms, and
told her where he was going, when and why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her dark eyes sparkled with quick pleasure. But
she exclaimed chidingly, “And that was what was in
those two letters you had from China by the first post
yesterday! And you’ve only told me now! A whole
day wasted, and with all the packing to do in no time
at all! Lo, you are simply wicked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since when have you done my packing, Mrs. Sên?
And I seem to remember that I not unfrequently have
done yours. My mistake no doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy giggled and tried to shake him. There was an
interlude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not take much luggage,” Lo told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Your</span> luggage!” his wife retorted contemptuously.
“Two handkerchiefs and a razor and a book of poems—I
know <span class='it'>your</span> luggage. But you don’t imagine that I
<span class='it'>and</span> Baby <span class='it'>and</span> Nurse are going half-way across the
world with only one suitcase between us, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear,” her husband said very gently, “we couldn’t
take Baby. It’s too far, the way too hard, whole weeks
of discomfort, if not worse—for you and him, I mean.
I shall enjoy every rod of it, with my goat-legs—and
home at the end of the journey. I never am ill, and, if
I were, the smell of Ho-nan would be all the medicine
I needed. But we can’t take our frogling off of the
doctors’ beats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” the frogling’s mother instantly agreed. “Oh—Lo—I
shan’t like leaving him behind. But—of
course—for his own sake—but, oh! Lo—how shall we
do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” he answered her quickly, with a
hand on her hair, “so you’ll have to stay with him,
mother-girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby Sên slipped from her husband’s arms, thrust
them gently but firmly away, and sat up on the pillows,
eying her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going with you, Lo,” she told him quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, a little tensely, “not this time. I
can’t take <span class='it'>you</span> to China <span class='it'>now</span>, heart of my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The time isn’t ripe. You wouldn’t be comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo thanked her with his eyes and with the
touch of his hands. They were lovers still, these two
who had ventured the perilous marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he persisted, “I cannot take you, dear. I’d rather
give it up than do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to go, don’t you?” she asked quietly.
“And you think that you ought?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that I ought. And I want to go more
than I could tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not to have me with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always that. But not to <span class='it'>take</span> you with me. I must
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby studied the yellow flowers on the blue eiderdown
a moment and then turned her eyes again to her
husband’s and searched his face, laying her hand, and
keeping it there, on his hand that lay on the lace below
her throat. She said, “Are you <span class='it'>ashamed</span> to take me
to China, Lo? Ashamed to have me there with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sudden color flooded the face of the Chinese man;
but he answered her truthfully and fairly, as he always
had and always would do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In every marriage there must be something of sacrifice—and
always it must be so, because the bonds that fetter
human souls one from the other are eternal set—always
have been and always must be—till we cross the River;
and it is in the higher wedlock, the happiest union, most
nearly perfected, that that sacramental sacrifice is the
greatest and costliest. In the sacrifices to come it might
be laid upon him to keep from her unsaid some of the
thoughts that welled to his heart and vexed his mind—indeed
already he had done so once or twice, eagerly
willing to bear tenfold any trouble alone rather than
to share it with her. But he never had lied to his wife
in small things or great, and it did not occur to him
to do it now in this hour of their intimate mutual testing.
And though he would instantly, ungrudgingly, have
sacrificed to her his life and things far dearer than life,
he could not sacrifice even to her his word—and truth
was a very part of his loyalty. There were white-skinned
women in London—a few—who pitied Mrs. Sên, even
while they sought her and made much of her—pitied
her because she was the wife of an Eastern—but there
were sadly few who might not have envied her had they
known the quality of her husband’s loyalty—exquisite
and absolute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ashamed!” he repeated. “Never that! Need you
ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid. Afraid for you, dearest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of what?” She would not let him off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he went on simply and bravely and left no
blank in this confession. “Afraid of slights and slurs.
They might not come, but they might.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need we care?” she demanded, pressing a little the
fingers under hers. “ ‘Where MacGregor sits <span class='it'>is</span> the
head of the table.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo made no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slights from whom, Lo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From my own people, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent over him then, and something as a mother
might. “ ‘Thy people shall be my people,’ ” she
crooned, “ ‘and whither thou goest there also will I
go.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo gathered his wife down to his breast
and held her there. Neither spoke. The room was
very quiet.</p>

<h1 id='t9035'>CHAPTER XXXVI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>But Sên King-lo had no intention of yielding. And
for several days they pitted their wills against
each other, while Mrs. Sên went quietly on with her
packing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His Chinese will and her English will met and interlocked,
and, because her will was a woman’s, Ruby won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruben went into the keeping of Lady Snow, “perfectly
delighted to have another baby without any of
the preliminary unpleasantness,” the overwatching care
of his cousin Charles, with Dick and Blanche for special
and voluble bodyguard; and the roses bloomed alone and
unpruned on the tiny cottage, and Kwan Yin-ko lived
alone in the Kensington house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you not like to live in China?” Mrs. Sên
had asked her husband one day before they left London.
“Make it our home, I mean? I have been thinking
about it a good deal these last few days. You have
been like a boy since you’ve known you were going
back to China.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Transplant my English flowers to the wilds of
China!” Sên laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruben is only half-English,” she reminded him,
“and I am your wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruben looks rather more English than you do,” he
retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s no answer, Lo. Listen—” she put her hands
on his shoulders and held them there. “I have been
very happy here. It has been splendid. I’ve loved the
fun of London and all the interest. But the one thing
I <span class='it'>care</span> for is to be with you and the boy. Truly, Lo.
I meant every word I said to you the other morning:
every bit of me did. I don’t care where we live. On my
soul, I don’t. Let us live in China—most of your
business is there. Take me to your own home, Lo,
and make me a Chinese woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her face in his hands. It was the only answer
he made her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you like to stay in China?” she persisted.
“We could come here for nice long visits sometimes.
Shall we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo laughed oddly. “We’ll try a trial trip
first,” was all he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was left at that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baby Ruben was taken to Kent, the old room Ivy
Gilbert’s mother had been born in made his day nursery,
with Jack and Jill, Little Bo Peep and all her sheep,
the Cow with the crumpled horn and the Old Woman
who lived in a shoe and found it crowded, newly papered
on the walls. Old Father Thames, in very bright blue,
meandered tranquilly beside them, with golden stars for
Oxford and Maple Durham, for Windsor and Eton, and
one very big star with two extra points for London
town. Sên King-lo and Ruby his wife crossed the world
together.</p>

<h1 id='t9108'>CHAPTER XXXVII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sên clapped her hands and the “boy”—a
wrinkled-faced Chinese of sixty—brought in the
teapot and the crumpets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had seen Lo’s chair as the bearers carried it up
the path, and she was sure he’d want his tea as soon
as he could get it, after being coolie-jolted all the way
from the Bund to the top of the Peak, this broiling,
brazen day. She knew she wanted hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She frowned a trifle impatiently as she rearranged
her tea-table a little. To Sung had forgotten the sugar
again. Lo didn’t take sugar here—but she did. Well,
she’d not take sugar today, for Lo would be here in a
moment now and, if she called the servant back to bring
it, probably Lo would hear and see; and she didn’t want
her husband to know that To Sung had forgotten her
sugar again—if he had forgotten it. It had infuriated
Sên King-lo when it had happened once before. His
face had blazed and he had hurled some terrible words
at old To Sung, and Ruby had seen a Chinese side of
her husband that she never had seen before. To Sung
had listened with an expressionless face to the torrid
abuse and had gone for the sugar basin when Sên had
ended. But only Mrs. Sên’s insistence had saved him
dismissal. “I thought you had to be deferential to
every old person,” she said as she sugared her half-cold
tea. “Every rule has its exception, even in China,”
Sên had told her, “and I’ll have no servant of ours forget
the slightest service to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not dare, for poor old To’s sake, to have Lo
know that he had forgotten, or neglected, to bring her
sugar again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were wonderful servants, these Chinese house-servants
of hers, and the bungalow on the Peak ran on
even smoother and more noiseless wheels than her admirable
London ménage had: more tempting dinners
even more perfectly cooked—service swifter and surer.
But now and then some personal English need of her
own was overlooked. And for all the expertness and
well-nigh perfection, Mrs. Sên felt that it was a chillier
service than that her London servants had given her.
She ignored it, tried to believe that she did not know
why it was, brooded over it rather, and hid it from Lo
whenever she could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the one small blemish in her delight in her
new life in a new place, though she began now to
wonder how soon people would begin to call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young China” has done some remarkable things to
Hongkong, if it has done nothing else. Sên King-lo
found Victoria less to his liking than it had been. But
Ruby, who was seeing her first of the Orient now, was
entranced with Hongkong. It was all so unexpected,
so unlike anything she ever had seen or imagined, that
its every oddity and burlesque had a charm and seemed
a picture. She never really tired of the bizarre kaleidoscope
of the Hongkong streets, but when she was a
little satiated with the incredible medley and cram of
the odd human mêlée and the narrow, sign-hung streets,
she had only to rest her eyes on the boat-flecked water,
or lift them for refreshment and delight that never failed
to the Peak and its slopes; and always she had the
home-haven of the bungalow and its hillside garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên saw it differently. Whatever his country had
gained in freedom and in international grip, he had
an appalling feeling that it had lost in beauty and in
manners. And once or twice he felt that the soul of
China was tarnished, and his taste, if not his reason,
veered more and more to Sir Charles’ attitude: “Would
that the Manchu were back on the dragon-throne.” It
seemed to him that the new Chinese Democracy was
overblown and that it was underbred. His countrywomen,
that he saw everywhere in the city streets, hurt
him almost intolerably. Chinese girls, no longer girlish,
“walked out with their ‘young men,’ ” girls so preposterously
clad that conjecture often might leave their
sex a toss-up, figures so absurd and meaningless that
no comic paper in Europe would have reproduced them,
or known what to call them if it had. Chinese women
wearing spats and rakishly tilted fur caps, thin peek-a-boo
blouses and scant tweed skirts cut half-knee high and
violently patterned with checks so big that neither a
“darky” woman nor a “nigger minstrel” would have
worn them in St. Louis or Chicago, stood in strident
groups on thoroughfare corners, discussing in shrill,
unabashed voices diseases and “causes” of which the
courtyard-sheltered woman never had heard. He saw
one making a “book” at Happy Valley, he heard another
call her escort “old bean,” and when he heard two young
Chinese girls placidly discussing abnormalities, sex, and
grimmer things with men not much older than they, and
saw an undoubtedly respectable matron at a restaurant
wearing a monocle and reading through it a French
novel of which he would not have allowed Ruby to touch
the cover, Sên King-lo felt that Ts’z-hi had died too
soon, and all the sweetness and soundness of Chinese
womanhood with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he reflected that Hongkong always had been a
drag-net for flotsam and jetsam, and he hoped and
<span class='it'>prayed</span> that when he had journeyed on into the interior
he should find his country less “advanced” and changed,
the waters still clear and tranquil in the lily-tanks, the
tulips and violets still at ease in the gardens, the wild
roses by the bamboo-edged waysides still white and
sweet. The emancipation of his traveled mind failed
him a little, and his soul revolted hotly that East no
longer <span class='it'>was</span> East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His countrymen struck him as less changed in appearance,
and less unmannered, than his countrywomen
did; but he missed the costume he himself had not worn
for many years. He missed old ceremonial greetings, old
suavities, old detachment, and even the down-hanging
queue and the tight braids of hair closely bound about
half-shaven heads. Many a man with whom he had
business offered him a whiskey and soda or a big cigar
who yesterday would have given him a tiny bowl of
tea or a long-stemmed, small-bowled, betasseled pipe.
Sên King-lo was as homesick for China in Hongkong
as he ever had been in Washington and was homesick
in a sorrier way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He always was glad to get back to the bungalow on
the Peak which he had taken and furnished for Ruby
through a cablegram sent from Vancouver. Sên King-lo
had not cared to take his English wife to a Hongkong
hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had been in Hongkong several months now,
during which time he had been away more than once
on the bank’s business, once with Ruby, twice without
her. He did not intend to take her with him again
when he went on a business journey. There had been
a hint of unpleasantness for them—not between them—more
than once on that one journey, hints that had
reached him more clearly than they had her. He understood
the language and the people; she did not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had amused herself comfortably enough on his
two brief absences, and he would have been glad to hope
that he might persuade her to remain in Hongkong
when he went to Ho-nan to see his grandmother at his
old home. Ruby had certain social assets here that
could not be ignored or too ruthlessly discounted. The
Governor was a lifelong friend of Sir Charles Snow’s;
his wife a distant relative of Lady Snow’s; and in London
Ruby and he had dined with them and they with
the Sêns. It had not been possible for Mr. and Mrs.
Sên to be excluded from Government House. And that
gave her a chance of amusement which might, he thought,
be a little more cordial if he himself were away. But
Sên knew so well that his wife would not be persuaded
to remain behind when he went to Ho-nan that, much
as he wished it, he scarcely urged it. What was the
use?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo began to see, faint but growing clearer,
the same writing on the wall that Sir Charles had seen,
and been aghast but not surprised to see, at Kensington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eagerly determined that this holiday and homecoming
of his should be all Lo’s, filled to the brim with all that
would make it happiest for him and pleasant to remember,
Mrs. Sên cared very little how many Europeans
called on her or how many did not; but she was keenly
anxious to know and “make friends” with Chinese
women, that she and Lo might come and go among
his Chinese friends, seeing them in their homes and
in the Sên home. Sên had hoped to gratify her in this,
believing that it would be easy enough under the change
in woman’s position in China. To an extent he had, but
it hadn’t worked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chinese ladies had called on Mrs. Sên—a few; two
had invited her to lunch; and one, more emancipated
perhaps, or perhaps more good-natured, or it even
might have been under a husband’s control, had gone so
far as to bring her daughters with her the second time
she called. She had dined once at the Sêns’ bungalow
and had once invited them both to dine with her husband
and herself—on which occasion neither of her daughters
had been present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all this visiting had been as barren to Ivy as Sên
realized it to be perfunctory, if not, as he suspected,
actually enforced. Ivy knew no Chinese. Only one of
the Chinese ladies who had called upon her knew a
few words of English. Great international issues may
be reconciled and solved <span class='it'>via</span> interpreters, but feminine
intercourse cannot be. The day Mrs. Sên lunched with
Mrs. Eng-Hung, the English lady was provided with
English cutlery; but its newness was assertive—almost
a protest—and the hostess ate with chopsticks. When
Mrs. Sên offered to shake hands with her Chinese women
visitors, the palms that met her outstretched hand were
instant and courteous but limp and irresponsive. And
the husband of every Chinese woman that called even
once either was under some large business obligation
to Sên King-lo, or aimed to be. Several Chinese ladies
whom, through their husbands, Sên had asked to call
upon his wife, did not do so. Sên had little doubt that
Mrs. Ma T’en-k’ai had made her sudden journey to their
country home rather than do so; and Ma T’en-k’ai was
deeply in debt to Sên for financial advancement. Yen
F’eng-hui, who owed more to Sên King-lo’s influence
than any other man in Hongkong did, frankly told
King-lo that he would not permit Mrs. Yen to know
an Englishwoman who had married a Chinese. He did
not blame Mrs. Sên for being English, that would be
absurd, since we all had be to born where the gods decree.
There were English ladies in Hongkong whom he would
not forbid his wife to meet, though he had no wish that
she should; but he held strong and unalterable views
concerning such inter-racial marriages. He hoped that
his honorable friend would pardon him. Sên King-lo
did more than that: he liked Yen for his upright frankness,
and courage—it takes courage to defy your banker—and
Sên King-lo could not condemn Yen, who had
never been out of their birthland, for feeling and saying
stoutly what he himself had felt as strongly scarcely
four years ago, he who had traveled far and wide, from
whom long foreign sojourn and alien associations inevitably
had rubbed off many natural angles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he did all he could to fill his wife’s Hongkong
hours pleasantly, to keep a sour thing from her. He
knew that he would be glad when they were once more
on the Pacific, with their steamer’s prow turned towards
the east.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lo did not notice the absence of the little sugar-basin,
and he drank his Chinese tea and ate his English
crumpets in high contentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can’t have done you very well at the Club
today at lunch,” Ivy said severely, as he passed his
cup for its second refilling and helped himself to a
fourth macaroon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had an excellent lunch,” her husband asserted,
“but not at the Club. I lunched and wined at the
hotel with a lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she gave you the flower in your coat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sên giggled. “You took Mrs. Yen out to lunch
on the sly! Did you have a private room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not,” Lo said sadly, “take Mrs. Yen out to
lunch. It would not have been permitted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy wanted a second cup of tea, but she would not
take it for fear that Sên would miss the sugar-basin.
She always took three lumps, and she knew that he
always watched her hands. So she munched a sandwich
instead and quenched her thirst with a mango.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I lunched with a lady, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife knew that he wanted her to say: “Who
was she?” and because she knew it, she said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And because she would not ask, he would not tell
her—yet. They often played that game, and Sên usually
won. If an English woman could wait, so could a
Chinese man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the home mail in, Lo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not even signaled yet, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên looked about the pretty room as he lit her
cigarette. They had finished their tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruby,” he said, as he gave it to her, well and
truly lit, “I believe you’d make home out of a soap-box
and an old coffee sack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d try for you, Lo,” she told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll match this against any room on the island,”
he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you furnished it,” his wife reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—by wire. But I didn’t <span class='it'>make</span> it. You did that.
I didn’t rearrange it. I didn’t put those flowers in
that vase or Ruben’s picture in its lacquer frame—”
Sên broke off, silenced by a sudden grinding thought.
He had seen and understood the look in Chinese eyes
when they first had seen that photograph, had seen and
quickly looked away. Ah well——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” he added, “I did bring the one perfect thing
in the room, and put it here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sên looked about her drawing-room in surprise.
What had Lo actually chosen and bought that was
here! Not the cabinet, not the screen, not the quaint
and costly teapot with a writhing dragon for handle
and a slender snake curled up asleep on its top, not the
lovely cups with butterflies poised on the delicate rims
and a dear little red “ladybird” inside each fragile
cup. What—then she understood and giggled again—a
pretty sound from her, if not a pretty word, and
shook her clasped hands at him in the pretty Chinese
way he’d taught her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not even for such a compliment (and they’d
been married almost five years now!) would she ask
the question he was waiting for her to ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I lunched, all alone, with a lady,” he said at last,
“and she is coming to lunch with you tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Mrs. Sên waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You used to know her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—some one turned up from London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, from Washington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy threw him a mock-horrified look. “Sên King-lo,
you have been lunching with Emmeline Hamilton!
She’ll sue you for breach of promise. What fun for
Hongkong! Lady Montsurat’s face will be a picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên laughed. Then he drew the carnation from his
coat and leaned towards her and tucked it in Ruby’s
frock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she knew that it was some one she had cared
for, cared for very much. And she cared for so few
people—for so very few women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lo,” she whispered, “it isn’t—it isn’t——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it <span class='it'>is</span>. Dr. Ray is in Hongkong, and Miss Julia
is with her!”</p>

<h1 id='t9463'>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy Sên laid her hand on her husband’s knee. She
was speechless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s true,” he assured her, “though I scarcely believe
it myself yet. Dr. Ray in Hongkong or in any
other interesting place seems explicable and natural
enough, but Miss Julia Townsend is stark impossibility.
But here she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have seen her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo smiled affectionately and a little grimly,
“No. She would not see me. But she is here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Lo, she couldn’t possibly afford it! All that
way—Washington to San Francisco—hotels—the boat!
She couldn’t ever do it. You have no idea how poor
she was really! She dressed like an old-fashioned queen,
and she had literally dozens and dozens of old chests—big
ones made of cedar wood—crammed with the costliest
things, a hundred years old, some of them, and yards
and yards of lace older than that; but I never knew her
to buy anything new to wear except gloves and boots
and slippers. I don’t think she bought even stockings.
She had dozens and dozens of pairs of silk ones—the
loveliest silk ones—some thin like cobwebs and some
thick as flannel; but she never wore anything else, winter
or summer. And besides all those she used to knit
others, and so did Dinah and Lucinda—she’d taught
them herself. She used to make her own handkerchiefs,
hemstitch them and monogram them and all. She almost
lived off the place. But she never sold a thing—not so
much as one thin old silver spoon, not a tomato, or
one of those funny turkey-wings Lysander used for a
crumb-brush. She <span class='it'>can’t</span> have sold Rosehill or anything
in it. She’d as soon have sold her mother’s grave, or
her portrait of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate flag
that had been in battle with Stonewall Jackson, or
Jefferson Davis’ autograph letters to her father. And
she never, never has let Dr. Ray pay <span class='it'>for</span> her. She
wouldn’t do that! She <span class='it'>couldn’t</span>: not a five-cent street-car
fare. How has she found the money? Oh—and
she always did so long to travel—above all to see China.
She has told me so time after time. And she had never
been out of Virginia farther than Washington, in all
her life, and never expected to be! Lo,” his wife cried
with a broken giggle that sounded full of tears, “she
must have sold Lysander and Dinah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever heard her speak,” Sên asked, “of a
second or third cousin of hers, Theodore Lee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Ivy had not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither have I. But Dr. Ray, who is several years
older than Miss Townsend, you know, though she looks
much the younger of the two—another case of work
keeping us fresher than rust does—Dr. Ray remembers
him perfectly. He, too, was quite a few years older
than Miss Townsend. He served under General Lee
in the Civil War—the youngest officer in the Confederate
Army, Dr. Ray says. He lost an arm at Ball’s Bluff
and a foot in the Battle of the Wilderness. The war
left him penniless, as it did so many, and his father
and older brothers were killed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a holocaust,” Ruby murmured sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most terrible holocaust in history until the
World War,” King-lo added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But slavery <span class='it'>had</span> to be stamped out, Lo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It usually dies a natural death,” the husband insisted,
“as it has in your own British Empire, and a
far pleasanter death for all concerned, the slaves included.
We have seen a pleasant and beneficent side
of slavery in China, as I believe the South did——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Townsend has poisoned your mind!” his wife
told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” he denied. “Facts are facts—that’s all.
And the war between the North and the South had
nothing to do with slavery. That was an after-thought,
dragged in for political purposes, necessary, perhaps,
and certainly good strong propaganda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sên King-lo! I don’t believe it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên laughed. “You didn’t specialize in American
history during your earnest scholastic career, did you?
However, as your own uncrowned laureate has said
several times, that’s another story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—do get on about Miss Julia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lee—young Theodore Lee—worked his way to South
America somehow. He had but little luck there, but
he saved enough to come home on a visit after some
years, and he spent a month at Rosehill when Miss
Julia was about sixteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you all that?” Ruby interrupted him
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Ray—today at lunch. He went back to Brazil
and had failure after failure there—just managed to
live for year after year. But he stuck to it, one thing
after another. He doesn’t seem to have had much of
a business head, but he must have had plenty of grit.
And his luck turned at last, nothing much, but it must
have seemed a fortune to him. He struck oil about a
year ago—alfalfa and rose-wood and ipecacuanha, I
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a mixture!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good many fortunes are mixed,” Sên observed.
“He turned his little pile into money and sailed from
Buenos Ayres almost at once—presumably, as the sequel
shows, to repeat his visit to Rosehill. But he died on
the voyage. He was buried at sea. That is the story.
He left Miss Julia all he had: nearly twenty thousand
dollars, Dr. Ray says. She has bought new clothes
now, Ivy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Black crêpe ones?” the girl said softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo nodded. “And the rest,” he added, “or
most of it, she’s spending in seeing the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby Sên’s eyes filled with tears. “And the rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A check to the Louise Home, flowers for Confederate
graves. She didn’t do it impulsively, Dr. Ray tells me.
They talked it over thirty or forty times. Then one
night suddenly, as they sat on the porch, Miss Julia
exclaimed: ‘I’m going to do it. It’s what I’ve longed
to do as long as I can remember, and I’m going to now.
I’ll put one thousand dollars in the bank, to make things
a trifle easier after I’m back, and to pay for my funeral.
My funeral has troubled me rather—especially if I
should happen to die soon after one of the garden-parties:
I’m sometimes a little short of ready money
then. My shroud is all ready, and the lot in the cemetery
was paid for long ago, of course; but there are always
extra expenses, and a Townsend must be decently buried,
and buried with Townsend money.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see Miss Julia on the rates,” Mrs. Sên said
shakenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” Sên King-lo said proudly. “ ‘I’ll put one
thousand dollars away, and I’ll spend every cent of the
rest and see China and Spain and the Bridge of Sighs
and Westminster Abbey at last,’ and here she is in
the best rooms of the best hotel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t think of Washington without Miss Julia
across the river at Rosehill,” Ruby said musingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I,” Sên King-lo agreed. “It’s like a harp
with its sweetest string gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how those poor darkies will miss her! And
what a time they’ll have! Dinah and Uncle Lysander
must feel like orphans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lysander and Dinah are here with Miss Julia,” Sên
chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sên gave a little gasping laugh. “Great Scott!”
she cried.</p>

<h1 id='t9644'>CHAPTER XXXIX</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Ray came soon after breakfast the next morning,
and she stayed all day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is your bridesmaid,” she told Ivy gaily, as she
took Mrs. Sên in her arms, then put her away a little
to search the younger face with shrewd, beautiful eyes
that hid the anxiety they felt. “I’m having the time of
my life. Nothing but slang will express it. Between
Julia Calhoun and this marvel of a place and the hotel
bills, I’m quite off my head. How are you, my child!
But you needn’t tell me; I only asked for manners. I
can see how you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy laughed happily. “How is Miss Julia?” she asked
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More so than ever,” Dr. Ray replied. “How I ever
am to get her home again, I don’t know. I thought I’d
never get her away from Honolulu. I must not say
that she went surf-riding, for she didn’t; but I know she
wanted to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scandal!” Sên King-lo rebuked their guest with a
quiet laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it,” Dr. Ray protested. “The scandal is
coming. But she watched the surf-riding and loved it.
She bought a Hawaiian phrase-book and climbed up
Diamond Head road to the peak on a pony. She wore a
<span class='it'>lei</span>! She went to a moonlight picnic at Weiniea, and she
saw a hula dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo’s face broke into ripples of fun, as only a
Chinese face can, and then the room moaned with his
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” Ivy expostulated, “Dr. Ray! How could you
let her do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let her! Have you never seen Julia Townsend with
the bit between her teeth? I have. Let her, indeed! I
assure you, this is <span class='it'>her</span> trip, and she runs no risk of my
forgetting it. She asserts herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She always did,” Sên said, with a tender smile on his
handsome mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” his wife agreed, “in her quiet, beautiful way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Julia is quiet still. But there is a sort of wonderful,
hushed splendor about her. I believe she has grown
an inch since we left Washington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In width?” Mrs. Sên asked smoothly. And they both
knew that she meant not “width” but “breadth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician shook her head. “But I wish you could
see the way she carries her head, the history of all the
Townsends in her face, a child’s unspoilt joy in her eyes,
and the Star-Spangled Banner waving over her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Star-Spangled Banner?” Sên reminded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was her fathers’ flag for nearly a hundred years,
Mr. Sên. At home she is a Southern woman first and
last. ‘Dixie’ is her anthem, Lincoln and Grant anathema.
But here she is just an American woman, proud of every
state in the Union.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she <span class='it'>has</span> broadened—very much,” Mrs. Sên
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Sên objected. “I fancy it’s merely a matter of
breeding; ‘company manners’ abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely,” Dr. Ray agreed, “a sort of traveling
cloak that she considers it good taste to wear. But, by
the way, Ivy, I did not ‘let’ Miss Julia attend the hula
dance. I was not there and did not even know anything
of her going until several days later. I was away in
Molokai. This is a pleasure jaunt for Julia, but I came
for a different purpose. There are several diseases that
I have wished for years to see at short range in their
native lairs. And when I found that Miss Townsend
really was making this trip—the wisest thing she ever
had done, I thought at the time, and now I know that it
was—I almost instantly decided to link my travel up
with Julia’s, and that’s how I come to be here now. Oh!
Is that Ruben?” She left the chair that Sên had placed
for her where the shaded breeze came in from the garden
and took up the photograph in the lacquered frame and
studied it minutely, with wise, kind eyes that again told
very little of the thoughts behind them. “Very, very
charming!” was her comment as she replaced it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t favor my side of the house, does he!”
Sên King-lo demanded with a laugh. “Our son is very
English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very, and very handsome!” Dr. Ray answered cordially.
But to herself the physician added: “And more
interesting than handsome. He is your <span class='it'>first-born</span>: a
throw-back, of course, to some blonde ancestor of your
wife’s. Baby number two may be as Chinese as baby
number one is Saxon. What then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did Miss Julia think of the <span class='it'>hula</span> dance?” Sên
King-lo asked slyly, as they sat at lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” Elenore Ray replied, “I have not been told.
She has never referred to it; but I gathered from Dinah
that her mistress spent the next day in bed, with the
blinds down. Uncle Lysander was certain sure powerful
scandalized. He claims to have blushed all over and to
have been nuffin but a jelly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do Lysander and Dinah think of China?” Sên
persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lysander is as frightened as if he were alone in a
churchyard at midnight,” Dr. Ray told them cheerfully,
“and Dinah giggles more than ever. I have to give her
‘drops’ every night to calm her—and I make them bitter.
Dinah does not add to the dignity of our party. Now
it is my turn to ask questions.” And she turned the talk
into more impersonal channels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she and Ivy sat alone for an hour in the garden
after lunch, they spoke only of Washington. The visitor
felt no impulse to question young Mrs. Sên. Her trained
eyes had seen with their first glance in the drawing-room
that all was well with Sên King-lo’s English wife. There
was not a cloud the size of a baby’s palm in Ivy Sên’s
horizon—or, if there were, Ivy had neither seen nor
sensed it. Their friend too had seen, clearly enough, that
the affection and confidence between husband and wife
had endured and grown. But she had caught a look
once or twice in Sên’s Chinese eyes that she had not
liked. And when Ivy in her turn left Dr. Ray and
King-lo alone for half an hour—not in neglect of a guest
but because the English letters had come and because she
knew how well they two would entertain and satisfy each
other—the physician turned to Sên presently and asked
him, as the quality of their mutual friendship and respect
licensed her to, “Tell me, my friend, how has it worked?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see?” Sên King-lo questioned for question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see that your wife is perfectly happy. I see that
you are beautifully satisfied in each other and that, if
you and she could shut the world out and keep it shut
out, all would be very well indeed with you both. But
that is just what none of us can do—and perhaps have
no right to attempt to do. Most of our troubles come to
us from outside, I think. I believe that the vital germs
of every one of them—always—are in ourselves, either
in some quality of ours or in some conduct, but that it
usually is the friction of cross-currents that develops
them. Something troubles you, Mr. Sên. May I know?
Can I help? It is the friend that asks, but it just might
be possible for the doctor to help—to see the way out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I smoke?” King-lo asked her, and lit his cigarette
slowly. Through its slender smoke he sat and
watched the bungalow garden, its bamboos and tulips
and fern-trees, and Hongkong down below the twisting
roadway, with its blur and huddle of Chinese homes and
shops and markets, and the gaunter, though prouder,
assertion of Europe’s overlordship, and the turquoise
sea beyond it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has worked perfectly,” he said after a time. “We
have had no regret—neither of us. Ruby, I think, has
not had an anxiety. I, when Ruben was coming, had my
bad half-hours. A Chinese baby would have been a
complication, even in London, the kindest, least censorious
place on earth and the most sincerely cosmopolitan.
You see a greater and a more obvious mingling—or, at
least, mixture of races in many other places; Constantinople,
Venice, San Francisco, and twenty others. But
it is only in London—only in London of all the world—that
there is genuine welcome for the strangers within
the gates. But in London itself there would have been
no place for a Chinese child <span class='it'>of ours</span>. And also, I
wondered how the sight of a Chinese baby in her arms—at
her breast—would affect Ruby. I have the type of
Chinese face—that we Chinese have now and then—that
does not bear country stamped on it too strongly. I
might pass as any one of several races, two or three of
them not Oriental or only remotely so, but it’s not a
family trait. Every other Sên I ever saw and every
other Pei-fu—my mother was a Pei-fu before her marriage—has
been unmistakably, strikingly Chinese in
appearance. And Ruby was used to me. She scarcely
remembered, except in a hazy, detached way, that I
was not English. But Nature plays many tricks, but will
brook none played on her. The Mongolian is a persistent
type; and such mixed marriages as ours, through some
inscrutable law of Nature, seem almost sure to perpetuate,
and even to emphasize, one racial type and to ignore
the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” the physician murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew that our child might be born more Chinese
than the Chinese—and I wondered if I might not see my
wife shrink, even a little, from the child our love had
given us. I was hideously anxious for her. And I dared
not say one word, give one hint, to prepare her; help
her, as that perhaps might have done, to resist an almost
inevitable revulsion—to destroy it before it existed. But
Nature spared us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This time,” the physician thought to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I saw how lily-fair our babe was——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you quite forgave him for looking so little like
your own people? I wondered, if you had, if you <span class='it'>could</span>,
when I saw his picture just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I worshiped him for what he had spared his mother,”
Sên King-lo said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He certainly looks a changeling, even for a child of
Ivy’s,” Elenore Ray said musingly. “Atavism is intensely
interesting—and very baffling.” She added,
“What is it that is troubling you, nagging you, then!—if
I may know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have used the one right word, Dr. Ray, ‘nagging.’
When the messages—there were two—came that
called me to China, I tried to come alone; but my wife
would not let me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course,” the woman said regretfully. “Must
you be here long—in China?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she knew, had divined, what his trouble was,
understood half of his dual trouble—for Sên King-lo
was carrying two, and they were quite distinct—knew
without any need of being told! But because she had
asked him, and because it was a relief to speak to one
he so trusted and liked, of what he could not have
spoken to any one else, unless perhaps to Charles Snow,
Sên King-lo went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As short a time as I can make it,” he replied. “She
wanted to bring our boy with us, of course; but there I
would not yield, and our physician backed me up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful people, doctors!” the physician remarked,
“and beautifully helpful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên smiled his agreement. “But I ought not to have
brought her,” he added gravely. “It was a terrible risk,
an unpardonable mistake, and I do not see how I am to
save her from finding it out. No one avoided us in
London. No one resented our marriage, or dared to
misunderstand it. She was too fine, too unmistakable—and
a little because I was so seemingly cosmopolitan, and
because London is London—at once indifferent and
wholesome. But here it is not so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Mrs. Sên been ostracized here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like that. The Europeans have been
supercilious—salacious-minded and evil-tongued amongst
themselves and behind our backs, I have little doubt.
And my own people have been hard, unbending. The
English sneer, more or less openly, and the Chinese have
tabooed my wife. An Englishman, a married man who
also has a Chinese ménage and children in it, called
here one day when I was out, and Ruby gave him tea;
but I happen to know that he has forbidden his wife, an
Englishwoman, to call on mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are going soon,” Dr. Ray said more cheerfully
than she felt. “Get her away. That is the only
thing to do. And you are going soon now, Ruby said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farther into China. To my own family. That will
be worse, I fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I hope not. She wouldn’t stay with me, I suppose,
while you went and came back for her? We could
take a little trip—to Japan perhaps—she and I. I will
part ways with Julia Townsend, for a time, or bring her
to reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d give a great deal if she would,” Sên replied.
“But she will not. It isn’t even worth trying. Don’t
think me ungrateful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that you are not that,” Dr. Ray said emphatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sên came to them from the drawing-room then,
her home letters read, Emma’s cried over a little—for it
had told her of Ruben’s first tooth and of a pair of tiny
new red shoes he preferred to suck rather than wear—and
nothing more of analysis or of confession passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late when Dr. Ray went back to her hotel down
in the city, and Sên walked beside her with his hand
on the edge of her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in high daylight (day is never garish in Hongkong)
the apish incongruities and misfitments of Young
China ways and clothes cannot rob Hongkong of its
unequaled beauty. The bamboos’ luxuriant, sword-shaped,
fern-like beauty still edges with gray-green lace
the twisting footpath between Victoria City and the
blue-topped Peak. Red Chinese roofs still up-turn here
and there among the persimmons and oleanders. Junks
and sampans still huddle in the harbor, and the water
still croons blue and green and limpid about them. At
night Young China seems almost a myth, an unloveliness
almost forgotten and quite negligible; the moon and the
stars keep their old state up in an imperial sky; lights
still shimmer like fireflies and flash like friendly arrows
of flame from bush and vine-entangled homesteads and
from long pendant lanterns swinging in coolie hands,
and down in the great craft-huddled harbor, lights
twinkle and proclaim in every color that man-made light
can show; queer, passionate Chinese music still throbs
now and then through the darkness, and English pianos
tinkle long after London’s bedtime; Chinese voices rise
and fall in velvet guttural across the night-time stillness,
and the laugh of a young English voice pierces it over
there behind the thicket of moon-drenched roses; a nightingale
sings in an old cherry-tree; and night moths wing
their filmy flight from the passion-flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they turned one of the steep, narrow pathway’s
sudden curves, they almost collided with a singing quintet
of young Chinese—two girls and three men, swinging
along all arm in arm and quite spanning the narrow
yellow path. They were singing an English music-hall
song stridently, the men dressed in European clothes
that <span class='it'>were</span> European—Bayswater or Battersea—the two
young women in “English” raiment that was <span class='it'>not</span>
English. One girl swayed a little as she walked, because
her golden lilies, disfigured now in sensible English boots,
had not “unbound” successfully. They drew aside to
let Dr. Ray’s chair pass, backing against the bamboos
at the road’s edge, still linking arms, still singing, but
much more softly, just keeping it up: “My mother-in-law
ain’t no jellyfish.” And they looked, as they were,
perfectly respectable and self-respecting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the descending chair had passed on, they swung
back athwart the path and went on again in step and
singing again in louder tones: “My mother-in-law ain’t
no lamb, and she ain’t no Venus neither”—crashing it
out to the Chinese night, where the moon above showered
the yellow path and the gray-green bamboos with a rain
of opals, and the nightingale broke off its fragrant song
in the old cherry-tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elenore Ray smiled, kindly, a little sadly, as she saw
Sên King-lo’s hand clench on the frame of her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are disappointed,” she told him gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Young China?” he replied frankly. “In some
of its surface tricks—candidly yes. Yes, Dr. Ray, I
carry two anxieties now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” he added stoutly, “every new movement has
its scum, and scum always rises to the top.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always,” she agreed. “But fulfilled dreams are
sorry things often. I sometimes have wondered what
George Washington would think of the Chicago Board
of Trade when it’s busy, and of the stock-yards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the cause for which he lived and fought and
worked was supremely right,” Sên reminded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We Americans like to think so,” the woman told
him; “but right gets terribly twisted in human hands
again and again. And the longer I live, the deeper I
probe, the more convinced I grow that ‘causes’ count
for strangely little, individual lives for almost everything—everything
that really matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you believe,” Sên King-lo questioned slowly—thinking
as he spoke of a Chinese Emperor of whom
Dr. Ray never had heard—“that in his record of personal
character, Washington left his nation a greater
heritage than he did in the victory of the War of
Independence and in all the great national foundation
he and Hamilton built after Yorktown?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that,” was the quiet reply. “In mental equipment
and achievement, I incline to believe that Alexander
Hamilton was the greatest genius in history, and certainly
the greatest of our country. But George Washington
was the greater man—because he was the more
entirely <span class='it'>good</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you hold,” Sên asked with a slight smile, “that
all who are good are great?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do—the <span class='it'>greatest</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The five harmless revelers were near them again, for
the hillside road had swung round on itself, and the
singers were not far away and directly overhead; and
the Leicester Square doggerel belched stridently down:
“My mother-in-law she’s got a walk like a crab and a
tongue like a toad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is not China!” Sên King-lo said, in sudden
unleashed passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me something—” the woman laid a motherly
hand on his hand that lay on her chair, and her eyes
that were very kind also were twinkling. “Do you hate
and despise the Manchus as much as you did?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” the Chinese man said quickly, “I do not. I am
older. And I see what I see.” He smiled back at her
as he spoke, but his eyes and his voice were sad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chair coolies came to a quiet halt, as they often
do at some point of special beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elenore Ray gazed about her with a sigh of great
content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you could have seen Hongkong as it was but
a few years ago,” Sên King-lo said, as they moved on
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is supremely beautiful,” Dr. Ray insisted.
“But,” she added musingly, “I begin to suspect that
the missionary and the gunboat have a great deal to
answer for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Chinese who have taken a wrong turning—if
they have—will have a great deal more to answer for,”
Sên King-lo said bitterly.</p>

<h1 id='t10096'>CHAPTER XL</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby had not noticed that her husband had avoided
going out with her in Hongkong and was avoiding
it more and more; but it was so. He was imperatively
busy now, crowding into days the work of business
drive and finesse that might well have over-crowded
weeks, if not months, for a less capable man. He could
not well take his wife to <span class='it'>hong</span> and to counting-house,
to long bank conferences that more often than not ran
with a strong political under-current—the very life-blood
of young China, if not of China itself—or to
more secret and smaller conclaves which took place
behind well-barred doors, when only two or three Chinese
gathered to speak together in slow, hushed tones and
anxious quiet words. But this was not the reason
why Mr. and Mrs. Sên so rarely were seen together in
Hongkong. The reason lay close and well-guarded in
Sên King-lo’s breast: a tiny coiled serpent that lifted
its narrow hooded head now and then, meeting Sên’s
eyes with sly, cold, wicked eyes, and sometimes at night
hissing softly in his ear. There were functions to which
he might have taken her, long rambles which invited
and beckoned, water-side strolls, leisurely peak-side
climbs. And there was Happy Valley, the incessantly
recurring Derby Day of all the Anglo-Chinese world
and his wife, and there was Church Parade, as smart
a function, if more narrowed, as London’s own, and
far more picturesque. But Sên avoided and evaded
them all whenever he could. Every hour that he could
spend with Ruby at the bungalow he did, and he filled
them all so full of intimate charm and gay comradeship
that they fed her all the happiness and content that
even she—greedy of both—could crave or assimilate.
And sometimes she chid herself sharply that she could
be so happy so far from Ruben. But Sên King-lo had no
doubt of her motherliness for he saw the look in her eyes
as they turned to the harbor on “home mail” day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo was doing his utmost, and his English
wife did not suspect—not yet, at least—the cancerous
price that a Chinese soul already was paying for a
bunch of red peppers an English girl had tucked in a
jade-green dress once in Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after Dr. Ray had visited them Mrs. Sên
insisted that her husband should go with her to a
shop in Victoria City at which she had been tempted
the day before by some ivories and a Satsuma gift-jar
she did not feel competent to buy without Lo’s endorsement
of their value. She knew she admired them and
<span class='it'>wanted</span> them. Lo would know whether they were admirable
or not, and worth half the stiff prices the
Chinese curio merchant asked for them. She insisted
that King-lo should go with her and decide. He had
no way of escape, unless he took the drastic one of
telling her frankly why he wished not to go shopping
with her in Victoria City. The risk of some discourteous
glance or half-smothered word that she might or might
not catch or interpret seemed to him less than the risk
of making to her the intolerable explanation. So he
yielded and went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door of the curio-shop, a famous shop which
rich globe-trotters had made a veritable Mecca of the
extravagant, Mr. and Mrs. Sên drew a little back to let
a woman, or rather a group of three, all parcel-laden,
pass out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia Townsend came first, her arms very full—she
never carried a parcel less worthy a place in her
hands than a prayerbook, a lace-edged handkerchief or
a vinaigrette, in Virginia. But the curio-hunter’s fever
was on her now, and she came from No Wink’s shop
hugging as many bulky and shapeless paper-wrapped
burdens as she could clasp in both arms and hands, her
long crêpe gown trailing behind her as never a skirt
of hers had dragged in the dust the plebeian populace
trod, before. Dinah and Lysander came just behind
her, each carrying a pack-horse load of bundles and
boxes and brown-paper knobs. Lysander looked mulish,
and his ebon was a sable pallid. Dinah grimaced as
she waddled, throwing friendly, fat, kittenish glances
to all and sundry as she came. Miss Julia moved, as she
always did, at a queenly pace, with a queenly mien; but
her old face glowed with the art-lover’s victory-look.
She thought she had found treasure of great price in
the curio shop of No Wink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doorway was narrow. Sên King-lo drew back
and uncovered, as he would to any woman for whom
he made way. His wife waited at his elbow noncommittal,
neither offering recognition nor advance, nor
hinting retreat. Miss Julia neither hurried nor slowed.
She looked at Mrs. Sên with unacquainted eyes, then
turned them on Sên King-lo and went leisurely on,
with a slight inclination of her proud old head, an
inclination paid to the small courtesy their drawing
aside had been but in no way an inclination to either
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her servants followed after her. Uncle Lysander gave
Sên King-lo a vicious glare that would have been insolence
had it been less absurd. But Dinah gave them
both a caressing giggle, and a wide look of friendship
and fealty out of her surprised faithful eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy passed on into the shop, with a proud little laugh
that was not cattish. And Sên King-lo stood and
watched his old friend until she was out of sight, his
hat in his hand, love and respect and regret in his
beautiful Chinese eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he turned and joined his wife and addressed
himself to the wares and the price-list of old No Wink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curio-seller was courteous. He knew of Sên
King-lo’s wealth, but his courtesy was frigid and unbending.
And Sên King-lo, who had laughed in his
generous soul at black Uncle Lysander, could have
throttled No Wink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much as he had loved her, tenderly as he always had
shown it, Sên King-lo showed his wife an added affection,
a warmer tenderness, a deeper deference that night. But
Sên King-lo’s eyes were sad even when they laughed
at her. And To Sung began to believe that his master
was crazy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They never saw Miss Julia again, rarely spoke of her
again to each other, and she never again to any one
mentioned either of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Sên King-lo went again, and alone,
to No’s curio-shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At lunch her husband gave Ruby Sên a string of
pearls. She already had more pearls than she often
wore; but she cried out in wonder at the burnished
pigeon-breast tints gleaming softly on these and examined
curiously the odd clasp of beaten and twisted lead
that fastened them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same afternoon Miss Townsend received from
No Wink, the curio-dealer, a cube-shaped, red crêpe-lined
box of camphor-wood and an obsequious note. He
begged his distinguished and generous patron’s acceptance
of the unworthy and nearly valueless curio he
ventured to offer her and explained that it was an old
and honored Chinese custom to make some humility
gift of appreciation to noble and liberal customers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia Calhoun Townsend did not relish accepting
a gift, no matter how small, from a shop-keeper
and said so to Dr. Ray, but she liked even less to resent
as an over-familiarity what so evidently was an act
of respect, and a Townsend always held old customs
sacrosanct. So she kept the “trifle,” and before she
left Hongkong, made a point of going again to the
curio-shop and spending there a sum which she made
no doubt was many times the value of the crinkled cup
in the camphor-wood box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Elenore Ray, who had given some study to
ceramics, though she had no idea that this bit of Satsuma
was one of the rarest pieces, the gem of No’s
collection, and had been, hundreds of years ago, the
rouge cup of an Imperial bride, knew that the brownish
Satsuma handleless cup was good and very old; and
she had no doubt who had paid for it and sent it as
a loving-cup, brimming with golden drops of “kindness
yet.” But, only seeing that it was carefully packed
and well guarded, she said nothing of what she
“guessed”—a Southern woman’s fineness of soul perhaps,
perhaps a physician’s deep-rooted habit of silence.</p>

<h1 id='t10276'>CHAPTER XLI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby, the wife of Sên King-lo, journeyed like a
queen when her husband took her from Hongkong
to the home of his fathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went a short way unromantically enough on the
new railroad. Then they made their long slower progress
across China in palanquins and by junks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second night they camped in a wayside inn’s
nondescript garden. Sên would not take his wife into
the comfortless, unspeakable native hostelry. He had
no wish to go there himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After they’d eaten, they sat a long time beside the
great sweet cone fire their coolies had lighted outside
Ruby’s tent; for as night neared, a cool tang came in
the evening air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A young crescent moon cut with its sickle the silver
and cinnabar sky, and a thousand stars pricked it with
emerald and sapphire and the red of Mars’ and of
Saturn’s ring. The atmosphere indescribably clear,
the fireweed still showed a crimson glow at the edge
of the gorge its lush growth fenced and hid, and the
perfumed smell of wild white roses and the heavier
scent of forests of honeysuckles was everywhere; but
the violets looked now swathes of white on the grass
about them, and the death of the sunlight had stolen
their green from the bamboos thicketed behind the
squalid inn, leaving the graceful, soft swaying but silent
bamboos a mistier, ghostlier gray, and their jointed
stems a duller bisque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Voices chanted on the distant pathway, for it was
springtime, the unmatched spring of China, and there
as in Chaucer’s England when spring comes with its
up-moving sap and its tender crinkling leaves “then
longen folk to gon on pilgrimages.” A band of crickets
chirruped to the moon, bathing their horned flanks
in the dew on the ferns. And Sên King-lo knew that
the hour had come to say what he dreaded to say: the
first positive, personal dread that ever had thwarted his
comfort and ease in her presence, with her hand in
his, a fold of her dress on his knee—for they sat on the
fern-bushed grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would say it now, but still he waited a little for
his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A temple bell in the distance answered its mallet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo had been eager to quit Hongkong, more
eager than glad; for fear had clutched cold on his
heart as they had turned from the island, off into China.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even as they newly journeyed his soul had
quickened and throbbed to his country. All that Europe
had wrapped about him as an intimate garment fell
from him as ash falls from a cigar. He was Chinese
again, only Chinese, wholly Chinese, and <span class='it'>at home</span>.
Westminster, Oxford, New York and Virginia were
farther from him and more alien than Mars and Orion.
Men he had known and liked, broken bread and thought
with, in London and Washington were as gone from
him, as nothing, as children’s names that the inexorable
pulse of the great tide has washed and ironed from
the seashore sands. The West was scarcely a dream,
less than a wraith or a sun-sucked mist that’s forgotten
in the yellow throb of an August day. Of all the West,
only one thing stayed with him now: the woman he
loved and their child—that, too, was exquisitely, sacredly
she—part of her body as of his, part of his soul as of
hers—the physical and spiritual fruit of the spiritual
and physical love of man and woman who were one—the
tangible signature of life’s greatest impulse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought of Ruby, leaning beside him here, contented
and confident, as of some white human rose he
had gathered and grafted into his being and keeping
here in the dear homeland that was hers as much as his,
hers, because his, and, because his, even more hers than
his own: his by inalienable birthright, hers by a greater
title-deed; more sacramented hers—doubly, trebly hers,
because it had given her Chinese wifehood and Chinese
motherhood, the supreme, imperial motherhood to which
all other earthly motherhoods are small and weak. And
he thought of his child as of a bud that the sun of a
Chinese love had warmed into Chinese life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every tiniest flower that grew by the wayside—commonest
flowers of Kent and Virginia many of them—every
bird that swung and fluted on a tree that shaded
their path, welcomed him home; and his soul denied,
his senses disavowed, that close-kindred flowers, birds
so feathered and throated, grew in any alien mileage of
Earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waterfalls that surged and flung, the tiny brooks
that tinkled over the pebbles and romped with the
baby trout that played in their happy iridescent bosoms,
were <span class='it'>real</span>, real water, real beauty, real message, only
because they were Chinese—Chinese cascade, Chinese
brook, Chinese water. There were <span class='it'>no</span> others. All places
beyond China were one dun, lifeless No Man’s Land
between Earth and Heaven, between Time and Eternity,
as bleak, fruitless, unbellied as a far gray stretch of
flat polar ice, as barren and lifeless and hopeless as
the Turanian desert at night. There was <span class='it'>nothing</span> but
China, lovely, laughing, forever imperial, his Mother!
And Sên Ruby was the white rose of China, twined in his
heart, soul of his soul, pulse of his day, dream and
crown of his night, who had perfumed his manhood
and borne him a son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo forgot Europe, the playing-fields of Eton,
the rush of hoofs at Goodwood, the books he had read at
Bloomsbury and at the Bodleian, geranium-hung houseboats
on the Thames, Big Ben’s luminous signal of time,
the clasp of Englishmen’s hands. He only remembered
the woman beside him because his manhood and loyalty
could not swerve even a hair’s-breadth from what she
had been to him, given him, trusted, consummated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he moved beside her now, a Chinese man with his
Chinese mate. Once or twice he had spoken to her in
Chinese, and only the English lilt of her good-natured
laughing at him had reminded him—jerked him back,
even with the music of its ripple, to the valley of
actuality with a bi-national quicksand under the tomato-red
of the succulent, toothsome love-apples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo never thought in English now, and when
he spoke to his wife as they journeyed on and on into
China, and still on and on, he had to translate the
word symbols of his thoughts before he spoke them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Translation is a thief. Always!</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Chinese who never have left the land of their
birth, the centuried home of their race, love China as
no other country is loved, the Chinese who have left her,
lost her a little in exile, as exiles must, and have found
her again, washing their homesick eyes in her beauty
and joy, laving their souls in her soul, must love
China even more. Comparison is the acid test. China
stands it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And <span class='it'>so</span> Sên King-lo loved China now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not love his woman less. But he loved his
country the more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now there was something he must say—the time
had come—something the kindness of which he did not
question, could not question, but the seeming-kindness
of which he doubted. How would it seem to her? Even—how
would she take it—she, he remembered it now
with a sudden sickness, who even in honeymoon’s <span class='it'>sans
souci</span> and complacent time had desired and bought visiting
cards engraved “Mrs. K. L. Senn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had meant to suggest it before they left Hongkong—but
occasions had slipped, or been crowded out. And,
too, in Hongkong, he had assumed that she took, as he
did, its advisability and convenience for granted. But
he realized now that Ruby had not. And in Hongkong
he himself had not realized it as the necessity he saw
it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been scrupulously tended and served as they
journeyed, but small danger signals had pricked his
quick and subtle intelligence, as broken twigs and twisted
vines or scattered grain, a feather caught on a thorn, a
bead dropped by a cactus, are messages of warning to a
Sioux. He had seen a look that was scarcely a look—more
a veneered masking crust than a look—on coolie
faces and the faces of pilgrims they’d met and passed—nothing
much—and yet—he kept his pistol well loaded
and lay at night across the curtain-door of her tent,
and his thoughts busied his mind as the silk-wrapped
shuttle busies the rapid loom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In London she’d said to him: “Make me a Chinese
woman!” She had meant it. Would she say it now?
Could she mean it now? He thought not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had liked Hongkong—in spite of its social coldness—as
a child likes a ribbon-tied box of sweetmeats,
and had nibbled at it much as the child nibbles and likes
its chocolates and nougats. But she had not warmed to
the realer China as they had passed through it. She
had exclaimed at its picture and beauty, laughed at its
“quaintness,” but he sensed that it had not touched her,
and that not once had she prostrated herself before it.
This soul-pilgrimage of his was a picnic to her: gaily
colored, well-provisioned, inimitably stage-managed—a
delightful kaleidoscopic interlude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few tricks of custom, manner or words had crept in
to her use during her Washington years, and no traits
of personality or thought. But the American vocabulary
is too apposite, it catches too neatly and firmly, not to
have irresistible appeal to all word-quick ears, and no
English girl—princess or housemaid—could listen as
often and as long as Ivy Gilbert had to voluble Lucille
Smiths and Mary Withrows without adopting a syllable
or so of a fresh young vernacular so limpid and forceful
that it needs no dictionary and grows a classic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hillside homestead, a small husbandman’s that
clung like a rosy fungus on the mountainous steepness,
morning-glories and long columbine ropes matting the
overtopping lemon-trees that flanked and perfumed it,
had lumped King-lo’s throat and quivered his lips as
they came into sight of it; Ruby had clapped her hands
at it when she saw it, and called it “cute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bird on a cypress-tree twittered some sudden domestic
anxiety to her absent mate, and Sên King-lo
turned to his wife and said in a slow, quiet voice:
“Ruby, I am sure that it would make our going through
these untraveled places easier and more simple if we
wore what Chinese gentlefolk wear—clothes not unlike
all those that the Chinese who meet us ever have seen.
And it would be a kindness to the old, untraveled grandmother
who is waiting for us in Ho-nan. Would you
mind? Would you mind too much, dearest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife turned clear laughing eyes to his anxious
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love it,” she told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo drew a long breath. And his heart blessed
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can we manage?” his wife reminded. “I
haven’t spied a shop since we left the railway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Sên laughed, “and you’ll spy none again until
we return to the railroad, unless a heap of mangos and
plantains here and there, with a more than half-naked
boy squatted beside them keeping the dragon-flies and
the white ants off, with a few coins in a wooden bowl
beside him for change, will pass muster for ‘shop.’ And
if it would, there’d be no chiffons or picture-hats or
peek-a-boo blouses for sale there. But I had thought of
that. And I have brought you all you’d need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Mrs. Yen select my Chinese frocks?” Ruby
teased him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She did not! Your husband selected and bought
them. Will you wear them, if you don’t dislike the feel
and look of them when you’ve put them on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will,” Mrs. Sên cried gaily. “And I
<span class='it'>promise</span> to like them, my venerable lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên took her face in his hands and brushed her cheek
with his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very rarely had he done that. But he had divined
long ago that his English wife, little as she liked or even
could tolerate kissing, would lack and miss something
of love’s legitimate sweetness, if he never paid her
the token that every loved wife in the West received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once in a great while Sên King-lo kissed his wife
lightly—her face or her palm—and when he did Ruby
Sên always laughed softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their lips had never met. And Ruby knew that he
never had kissed Ruben. She did not often do it herself—and
then only a bath-fresh dimpled hip, or the
“sugar-spot” on the back of the baby neck.</p>

<h1 id='t10559'>CHAPTER XLII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>At daylight Sên Ruby came out from her tent, clad
for the first time as Sên ladies had been since the
older garbs of China (Japan, imitative in all things,
wears them now) had been discarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was laughing as she came, delighted with her new
masquerade; it made her feel she had dressed for a big
charity function of dance and fun at Albert Hall—highly
pleased with herself and her fine new quaint
clothes. Lo had chosen them well. He had chosen every
“prettiest” garment she had had since her marriage.
Her hair had been the most bothersome. She’d puffed
it out and screwed it up; but it wouldn’t stay stiff,
and its slight but established curliness would not “keep
put”: it didn’t look right, and it felt horribly wobbly.
Never mind, she’d try again after they’d breakfasted,
and Lo should get her flowers and dangling buds to
stick in it at rakish celestial angles! What fun! She
wondered if Lo had brought his camera along. She
hoped so!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Chinese man came to meet her, a gentleman far
more bravely clad than their servitors—more expensively
clad, she thought, than she’d seen any man before; for
Sên’s Chinese friends in Hongkong she had seen in
Western dress only. How curious his clothes were!
She didn’t like them. Chinese women’s clothes were
picturesque and comfortable—the best of all clothes
for fancy “dress up.” But these Chinese masculine
garments that she saw now almost for the first time,
she did not like; she thought them fantastic, absurd,
unmanly—only fit for a comic opera. Who was he, she
wondered, and how did he come to be here in this wild
countryside—no dwelling for miles, but the tumbled-down
inn with fat pigs and thin hens strolling in and
out of it—this richly dressed man in a fur-edged under-coat
of turquoise cashmere, a top coat of violet silk,
and a skirt of gentian-blue-embroidered bright green?
A man in petticoats! But she gave the stranger a
courteous glance—Lo could not be far away. Then she
smothered a giggle. Did the bedizened and skirted
stranger think she was Chinese, she wondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repulsion disfigured her face, and she shrank back
as she involuntarily screamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It <span class='it'>was</span> King-lo!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she was his wife—the wife of a man in a petticoat!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had screamed softly—scarcely a scream, but it
had cut Sên King-lo as a sharp, poison-steeped sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife made her amends at once, laughed at her
own silliness, pretended it had only been that he’d
startled her. He’d said—she remembered it now—“if
<span class='it'>we</span> wore;” but she hadn’t thought of it, hadn’t thought
of anything but her own fine new things—they were
lovely, perfectly sweet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they both knew that it was not surprise, but
horror and revulsion, that had wrung that half-scream
cry from her whitening lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They made the best of it—passed it by—both too
well bred, too brave, and too kind to do less.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it stayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And shyness—that slowly grew almost to strangeness—crept
between Sên King-lo and his wife.</p>

<h1 id='t10639'>CHAPTER XLIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>In the miserable days that followed that day, Sên
King-lo’s loyalty never swerved, but his love reeled.
He still loved his wife—love does not die in an hour;
only slow torture and persistent mal-usage can kill
love—but his contentment in her was maimed. But his
loyalty held, for he clung to it fast, and loyalty won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wooed her again, with no show of passion, but
taxing every resource of his splendid nature and subtle
mind to draw her back to her old confidence and contentment.
His contentment was bruised and marred,
but his soul resolved that her contentment and ease
should return. There were men in England and
America who ranked Sên King-lo high, as high in ability
and skill as in character—and they all were big men
and wise, and skilled in their weighing and gaging of
manhood. But never before had he been so nearly
great as he was now, or so fine in method and difficult
achievement. He demanded nothing, pressed nothing,
labored nothing; but he heaped her comforts about
her, anticipated her needs and created them. And
presently his charm reached her again (even through
the Chinese motley it wore) and steeped her again in
warmth and satisfaction. He wooed her again for himself
and succeeded in his suit. He wooed her, too, for
China and failed, failed in the pictured loveliness all
about them, as he knew he perhaps was destined to fail
again in the teeming home of many people and old
customs to which he was taking her now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke of the beauty about them, its delicacy and
majesty; tiny flowers in the brookside moss, rivers of
white light, torrents of shadow on great crags and
mountain forests—but she never <span class='it'>saw</span> it. And Sên
King-lo knew; but he tended her gently and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At night, when dusk and darkness curtained, he came
to her tent, or threw himself down by her side on the
ferns gaily, wearing once more his light English tweeds
and carrying an English book in his hand, an English
jest on his lips, or gossip of cricket and golf. He longed
to read Yuan Mei (China’s garden genius of happiness,
of thought, and of singing) to her here where the
world was steeped in all that had moved Yuan Mei to
song: longed to give her (because she was his, and he
hers) what Yuan Mei, Tu Fu, and Ou-Yang Hsin had
given him, what China gave him; but he bottled his
longing up and read “Daniel Deronda,” or, instead, a
novel from Mudie’s, a <span class='it'>Morning Post</span> leader, or verses
from <span class='it'>Punch</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His heart ached, but his nerve never failed or his
vigilance slacked. And all the time China was calling
him, claiming him, possessing him wholly, as a child
in the womb of his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child leapt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the man stood to his ploughshare, held to his bond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the fear in a woman’s eyes died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coolies sniffed at the verdure about them, as
they shouldered the chairs and boxes and trudged gaily
on; for Chinese spring was turning to Chinese summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came on the edge of his home suddenly at noontide,
a day of riotous color and warmth. The half-mile
from the outer gate to the wide-flung, tulip-tinted dwelling
looked but an easy breadth in the clear, ambient
radiance: a long, leisurely house, that looked a series
of houses, sprawled among persimmon trees and violet
walks, the under-lip of each up-curled roof elaborately
carved, a house so much lower than the trees beyond
it that it looked, here from the hillside above it, like
a clumped growth of red and pinkish mushrooms crowding
close together in a nest of white and yellow lilies
and ferns—for some of the roofs had been newly painted
and varnished or glazed, and blazed red in the sunshine,
and some were faded and blinked palely pink. A forest
of oak-trees stretched in the distance. A <span class='it'>pai-fang</span> with
markings of gold and silver on its crimson lacquer stood
spruce, graceful, and speckless in a garden of tulips
scarcely a stone’s throw from a small shabby temple.
Peasants—scantily clad, and clad too alike to show of
what sex at a distance—squelched in a great paddy field
and chattered, so it seemed—Ivy could not hear them
so far—under their great sun hats as they bent to their
wet, oozing work. An old woman was carrying on her
back a bundle of faggots, larger than she, into a kiln-shaped
outhouse; an urchin who wore very little but
ropes of marigolds—one on his head, one on his hips,
three round his neck—was perched impudently on a
great, patient buffalo, driving it round and round a
dripping water-wheel and thrashing it sternly with a
long, harmless branch of young, pliant willow. Peacocks
promenaded the terrace. Ducks quacked thirstily
in a clovered meadow. A beautiful mare nuzzled the
colt that was nursing her and washed its back with a
fondling tongue. A cow called to her calf. A spinning-wheel
hummed in a near mat-hut. Two graybeards were
playing backgammon under a mulberry-tree. Children
were at play on a far hillslope, for kites rose from it
like a school of excited (if not scandalously tipsy) butterflies.
Dozens of tiny dogs scampered and yapped
on a mignonette field, and others slept in the sun. A
cat was chained to a sundial. And roses clotted everywhere;
more roses and more kinds of roses than ever
grew in Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the homestead place bristled and sang with human
life; anvils rang, chisels scratched, saws rasped, grain
ran like noisy sand in the man-made chutes and conduits;
frail, busy smoke curled slowly up from dozens
of twisted chimneys; an employed, thriving, bustling
world, the home-hold of the Sêns. Beyond its low,
stonewalled boundaries all was wild and silent—a great
active hive of human affluence, set in an untouched wilderness
of Nature’s holding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo caught his breath, and his eyes filled
with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby Sên’s eyes did not kindle. She smiled a little—and
involuntarily a word came in her alien thought:
“Caravanserai.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A servant came running, others ran at his heels. The
high doorlike gate was unchained, unbarred, and opened,
and the guard-devils—or perhaps they were gods—painted
on it drew apart and aside, as if making obsequious
way for the Sên who had come home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Sên King-lo with his hand on his wife’s litter
walked slowly on to the house in which another Sên
Ruby had borne him and died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo’s soul flamed; but he leaned down to his
wife as they went—between prostrate retainers now—and
spoke to her with as light unconcern as he might
have done at the Eastbourne or Windermere end of a
long day’s journey.</p>

<h1 id='t10788'>CHAPTER XLIV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sên knew before they left Hongkong (for
Sên King-lo had told her, explaining it all as well
as he could) that she would find odd customs, some,
at least, of them unwelcome and irksome, to which she’d
have to conform at the home of Sên Ya Tin. In Hongkong
she had accepted and assented cheerfully, gaily
even—thinking them all part of the fun and, too, sincerely
holding them part of the nothing-price to pay
for the pleasure of going with him and for the great
adventure of making a long Chinese journey in a Chinese
way, of seeing his childhood home and sharing it with
him, and feeling radiantly and deeply sure that any
personal, discomfort, embarrassment even, of hers would
be a joyful contribution to make to his happiness. But
she found it hard to feel so now, even at first; and as
the days passed and the newness a little lost color, and
the dullness and out-of-placeness deepened, she found
people in fantastic clothes with grotesque manners and
it impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gave her great greeting—these funny Chinese
ways, who thronged the old homestead—and they gave
her ceremonial and elaborate attendance and entertainment
that also was heartily kind. But it all both
bothered and bored her, and it repelled her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had expected immediate and affectionate grandmotherly
greeting from a touched and grateful old lady
to a young mother and wife who had come so far to
visit her—and had left her baby across the world and
its seas to be able to do so. She did not see Sên Ya Tin
for more than two days. And when she did old Ya Tin
did not come to greet her but sent for her grandson’s
wife to come to her presence, inclined a head to her
proudly, scanned her with calm, slow eyes and very
sharp ones, gave her three small sweetmeats, and dismissed
her with a thimbleful of pale, boiling tea—and
then apparently forgot her for days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had planned to go everywhere hand-in-hand with
Lo, he showing her where he’d flown his first kite, spun
his first top, stolen his first bird’s eggs; giving his childhood
to her as he found it again for himself. It seemed
to her that she scarcely saw King-lo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was not true; but he and she were together far
less than they ever had been, even when he was busiest,
since their marriage. His grandmother commanded and
engrossed him; his kinsmen—there were thirty-six of
them here at the homestead—surrounded him, and tore
him away. And when he came to her, even his consummate
adroitness was not enough to hide from her
that his truer being was off with his kindred—in the
<span class='it'>k’o-tang</span> with his grandmother or out in the far open
with the men of his blood. Sên Ya Tin was <span class='it'>everything</span>
here—all others but her satellites and chattels. Ivy
never had felt so “small” before. Even the nursery
governess at Washington had had more freedom and
been of far more consequence. Chinese etiquette and
customs hedged her about, and she felt that they
throttled and insulted her; most of all they bored her
very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On her arrival she had been taken at once to the
harem quarters and, unavoidably, Sên King-lo had not.
Even in her smothered rebellion she could not fail to
see and think that the harem rooms and courtyards
were very beautiful, but a eunuch stood or lay at each
entrance! And her British gorge rose at her close
proximity to Sên C’hian Fan’s three wives, who pressed
about her all at once, felt her face with their hands, as
if to see what it was made of, giggled and screamed at
her feet, pulled down her hair with pitying squeals,
and summoned a tire-woman (who was a concubine
also and made no secret of it) to put it up “right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was not imprisoned, but she felt so. She passed
in and out of the “flowery” quarters as she would, and
no eunuch ever gestured or glanced to stay her. For Sên
King-lo had made his request, and Sên Ya Tin had given
her orders. She roamed the great domain as she chose,
but when she returned the concubines whispered together
apart and looked at her in a way that told plainly that
they regarded her as abandoned, lacking in self-respect—if
not worse. And in England she had a vote!—Or
had, unless alien marriage had lost her it—while
here——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the babies saw her as “strange,” and only the
most complacent of the plump little crawlers and toddlers
would suffer her hands or her friendship. But those
of them that would were her safety valve and alleviation.
Even so, they hurt her; for they made her sharply
homesick and panged her with an added knife-like ache
for Ruben. It had not been easy for Mrs. Sên to leave
her baby in England. She had done it because she <span class='it'>could</span>
not let Sên leave her; but it had hurt almost intolerably,
and the sight and sound of the Sên babies here—they
were Ruben’s kindred, and twelve of them were babies
in arms—rubbed her sore mother-hurt raw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gave her a chamber of her own and a courtyard
of her very own, too, but even the fear of Sên Ya Tin
could not keep the other women out. They were all
over her—chattering, laughing, tweaking queer little
instruments, scolding servants who scolded back, handling
her most intimate belongings, handling her. The
“flowery” was a beehive of women, and sometimes Ivy’s
indignation called it a monkey-house of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were the kindliest, merriest things on earth.
They were curious, of course, childishly curious, to gaze
on the human curio she was to them—not one of them
ever had seen a European before—but their close pressing
and constant attentions, that she so abhorred, were
at least nine-tenths sheer womanly kindness. Even
the concubines were sorry for her—so far from her own
home and so uncouth and untaught—she hadn’t even
a painted face, poor thing—and they all were heartily
anxious to sister her and make her at home. And they
went to work at it with one united will. They gave
her their baubles; they tried to teach her blind-man’s
buff—and failed as Blanche and Dick had failed before
them; they tried to lend her their prettiest clothes, their
pipes, and their face paints. They implored her, in
words she could not understand, and in gesture and
clutches she could, to gamble with them; and Mrs. Sên,
who had bought her platinum and diamond wrist-watch
with bridge winnings, was disgusted. And they never
left her alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prettiest woman there—and even Ruby saw how
pretty she was—was the youngest concubine, and her
baby was the prettiest baby of all the fat, dimpled lot.
The girl had a tender heart and an unspoiled soul. Her
eyes filled with tears sometimes when she saw Sên
King-lo’s foreign wife sit silent and listless apart. One
night La-yuên cried on her mat because she was so
sorry for Sên Ruby, and the next day she brought her
tiny baby and laid him in Ruby’s lap. And the baby,
after one startled look, laughed and held up his wee
hand and clutched at Ruby’s beads. And Ruby caught
him closer and held him to her face—snuggling and
loving him in spite of his sad, smirched birth; forgetting,
not sensing, that the sins of the East are not the sins
of the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all sorry for her, and sorriest because it
was whispered that the lord King-lo, even in the terrible
land where they lived, had not even one concubine; and
they all were very kind to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nowhere else are social barriers at once so high and
so negligible as they are in China. A Chinese lady chums
with her maid—between the whiles she cuffs and beats
her—eats with her, consults with her, gossips with her.
And this disconcerted and revolted English Ivy even
more, if the truth must out, than the ever present
and patent concubinage did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo came to his wife as often as he could.
At Sên Ya Tin’s decree, startling but not to be questioned,
rules of social sex decorum were scandalously
relaxed. Sên King-lo had access to his wife at all
times, of course, and because—that she never need lack
friendly faces and voices about her—she was quartered
so unisolated from her new kinswomen, in going and
coming to her King-lo came more in touch with the
haremed ladies of his kinsmen than was Chinesely decent,
and far more than old Madame Sên would have
cared to have it whispered abroad. And he saw several
Chinese girls now—unmarried daughters of the house,
but he thought little about any of them, and neither the
wives nor the maidens seemed to resent it—unless giggling
is a protest. Ruby still wore her Chinese dress
invariably, but he came now and then in his English
clothes. The first time he did there was a harem riot,
for one of the women had spied him, or a eunuch or
a slave girl had seen him and told; and the little painted
ladies tore pell-mell into Ivy’s room, pushing and jostling
each other in their mad rush to see and to touch, and
women who never had left their own precincts or seen a
forbidden man, much less let one see them, nearly
ripped Sên King-lo’s coat off his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And one tripped and fell—fell thump across King-lo’s
knees, and Sên King-lo chuckled and chortled with glee,
and so did the tumbled one’s husband who came in
then to see what all the noise—excessive even in a
Chinese “flowery”—was about. He’d no business there
of course, in Sên Ruby’s apartment; but she went freely
among his kinsmen, so that did not so much matter; but
that he was here with his kinsmen’s unveiled Chinese
women was an enormity. But no one seemed to mind
in the least, and the fun ran fast and shrill. Sên Po-Fang
caught his wife up by her girdle and shook her,
and she slapped his face, and they both giggled—and so
did every one else except Mrs. Sên King-lo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They devised many a rout and festive function for
foreign Sên Ruby—games, temple picnics, fireworks,
peacock-races, kite contests, juggling, wrestling, a play
enacted by performers sent for from many miles away—and
when the monthly festival came they kept it with
even unwonted observance and noise—for Sên Ruby.
All that China was they tried to give her, all that China
had to show they showed her—because she was a stranger
come within their god-guarded gates, and because the
lord King-lo had held the cup of hot marriage wine to
her maiden lips and drunk it with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ruby thought it all absurd, uncivilized; found it
tame and paltry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Julia would have revelled in it, would have
found and greeted the soul in it all and threaded out
its meaning, learned its histories, loved its pictures.
In a slighter way, Ruby would have done so too, had
she come upon it merely in privileged travel, had she
not been the English wife of a Chinese man—the English
mother of a half-Chinese child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ruby Sên hated it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She liked the food; <span class='it'>no one</span> could help liking the best
food on earth. But she found meal-times abominable,
except when Sên King-lo came, which he did whenever
he could, to take his rice with her. When he did not
she ate alone as often as she could; but even then the
women crowded in—there was neither a door nor a key
in all the place—to watch her eat, greatly excited at
her plying of forks and knives, for Sên King-lo had
brought those from Hongkong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby hated it all, and most of all she disliked Sên
Ya Tin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sên Ya Tin liked Sên Ruby.</p>

<h1 id='t11033'>CHAPTER XLV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>When King-lo left his wife at the fragrant apartment’s
outer entrance, he had gone to the outer
gate again and waited there until Sên Ya Tin should
summon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sent for him soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat immovable on the great carved and inlaid
chair on the red-covered daïs at the far end of the great
<span class='it'>k’o-tang</span>, as Sên King-lo came through the opened panel
and k’o-towed thrice to the floor. A slave in the outer
room closed the panel again, and they two were alone
in the great carved room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên Ya Tin was not old as Western women count
years now. But she looked very old, for life and her
own flaming spirit had scorched and burnt her. Her
face was as brown and crinkled as an autumn leaf that
the lightest touch will flay into dust. Her black eyes—time
had not dimmed <span class='it'>them</span>—glittered diamond-cold and
hard, under her snow-white eyebrows which tweezers
had shaped and torn into almost the sharp shape of the
accent that crowned the proud name of Sên—narrow,
almost thread-like eyebrows that were so silken that
they glistened on the brown parchment of her wrinkled
forehead like sun sparkled snow streaking a rough brown
rock. Her hair was as white and as glistening as they,
fantastically dressed, and bristling with costly stickpins.
Her tiny brown hands—more claw-like than
human with no look of age’s exquisite softness about
them—were arrogantly wide-spread on her robe, every
finger and one thumb covered from joint to knuckle
with blazing gems, seven of the eight fingers tipped with
heavy jeweled nail-protectors more than finger long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very tiny figure that sat bold upright in
the huge chair. Her blunted scraps of feet just peeped
arrogantly beneath the fur hem of her turquoise-tinted
trousers, just resting on a cushioned teak-wood stool that
was higher than most such footstools, or else the tiny
woman’s tiny feet could not have reached it. Stripped
of her heavy robes Ruby Sên might have lifted and
carried her. But her embroidered robe of yellow brocade
must have weighed as much as she. It was not the
sacred imperial yellow, of course; but it <span class='it'>was</span> yellow,
which it had no business to be. There is no sacred
color in China now, alas, and perhaps not too much
else that is sacred in the old imperial way. Alas, and
alas! But that was not why Sên Ya Tin sat with jeweled
yards of satin brocade about her. The lady Sên took
little notice and no “stock” of Young China. She
held with old ways, waited serenely for them to return,
and kept them here as she always had. This was
a learned woman. She could both read and write. The
blind scribe that squatted by his low bamboo table in the
fragrant courtyards and wrote for the wives of her sons,
when those letterless ladies wished to write to the homes
that had been theirs before marriage or purchase, never
did personal service for Sên Ya Tin. She knew, too,
her country’s history. She knew that, though individual
insanity had been unknown until European intrusion
had bred it there, China had suffered civic and national
insanity before, and more than once—before the birth,
nine centuries ago, of Wang Ah-shih, the poet father
of Chinese socialism, and after that erratic Prime-Minister
of the easy-going Emperor Shen Tsung had
gone on high. But always the convulsion had been
short. Socialism and peasant-franchise had strutted but
a day. Then China had shaken the distemper off and
returned to her state. Sên Ya Tin looked for China
to do it again. The new Republic troubled Madame
Sên as little as it concerned her, but she always had
hugged a personal vein of wickedness of her personal
own. And because she had no right to wear even a
tinge of yellow, she often did, and often had since
widowhood had made her supreme in the house of
the Sêns. No one outside her gates would know, for
no one within her gates would presume or dare to
report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vase of almost inestimable value, a porcelain saucer
of melon seeds, with a tiny-bowled, long-stemmed silver
pipe, a tinder and a gold-lacquer box of fine tobacco
and a tiny queenly fan lying near it, stood on a small,
octagonal, carved teak-wood table beside her; a small,
tight bouquet of mint and sage and musk lay on her
lap; a tiny tame monkey, tethered by a silver chain,
perched on the top of the tall, throne-like chair; and
about her neck Sên Ya Tin wore, as she always did,
the long mandarin chain of cornelian beads of her
dead husband’s—as the widow of a British officer often
wears his regimental badge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat with her face square to the panel that had
slid open for King-lo and slid close again behind him,
and her unmoved face was a wrinkled, lifeless mask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three times Sên King-lo k’o-towed to the floor, then
stood with downcast eyes and hands meek within his
wide sleeves and waited for her to command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let him wait, neither pleasure nor love nor welcome
in her adamant eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water-clock dripped a long minute away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo did not lift his eyes. Sên Ya Tin did
not move hers. She watched him stiffly through unwavering
narrow lids—and so did the mouse-sized
monkey, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Approach!” she said in a cold, relentless voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo neared her by three slow steps; his padded
Chinese shoes made no sound as he moved; his hands
were still hid in his sleeves; his eyes were still on the
floor. And then he k’o-towed again, and again three
times, then stood and waited as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she let him wait—but not so long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three steps more he went, three more obeisances he
made, and as he stood again erect he lifted his eyes to
the face of his father’s mother. And Sên Ya Tin sent
her eyes to his, steady old eyes, harder than age, that
looked but told nothing, gave no hint or sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nearly twenty years since his eyes and hers
had met; for she had been ill with smallpox when he
had been in China last, and she had forbidden him—as
her will and self-control had forbidden the smallpox
to disfigure her. And boy and pox had obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him long, coldly. And he waited for
her to signal or speak; to beckon or dismiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes were the eyes of her father. A silver nail-protector
studded with diamonds clattered a little
against a pearl-studded one of gold. His mouth was
the mouth of her favorite and first-born son. The cornelian
beads moved a little on her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, very slowly Sên Ya Tin rose from her seat,
came from the daïs, spurning the high footstool from
her way, tottered across the glass-like mahogany floor
on her tiny, tuber-like, satin-shod feet. Still Sên King-lo
did not move. Her face broke up a little. His eyes leapt
to her then. A cry that was only a whisper of sound
breathed from her lips that scarcely moved. Sên King-lo
took a step—another—two more, and she hid her working
face on his coat. Her grandson’s arms were about
her. They held her close, his head bent low to hers.
Her hands fondled his sleeves. She was quivering now.
He heard her heart beat under all its harness of silk
and satin, embroidery and jewels, and she heard his.
She was sobbing now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yam-Sin, the monkey, pounced on the porcelain saucer
and gorged himself on melon seeds that snapped briskly
between his strong, tiny teeth, his silver chain clank-clanking
against the high chair’s inlaid wood; the tiny
pipe of an august lady clattered to the floor; and the
fine, silken tobacco streamed after it, raining down
from an upset lacquer box.</p>

<h1 id='t11206'>CHAPTER XLVI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>The Chinese doyenne and autocrat of the Sêns and
the young English wife of the house met two days
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the meeting was not awkward, it was badly circumscribed.
Ya Tin knew not a word of the other’s
tongue, and Sên Ruby scarcely a score of Ya Tin’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their meeting was only decently ceremonial, and
Madame Sên had made no elaborate and hampering toilet
today. She was a sensible old creature and did the little
she could to give the younger and so foreign woman a
friendly and unembarrassing welcome. Since she had
consented to receive Sên Ruby at all and in doing so
acknowledge and condone a marriage she strongly deplored—and
she had consented in reply to a letter
King-lo had sent her from London, her answer reaching
them in Hongkong—she, having consented, intended
to show Sên Ruby all not too inappropriate kindnesses.
But the language barrier was insurmountable. Sên
King-lo acted as interpreter, but conversation so spoken
cools in the process and grows increasingly difficult.
And Sên Ya Tin was by nature and habit unbending
and had no knack of assuming an easy congeniality that
she never had felt. She had few affections; the few
that she had were veritable passions. But between them
and icy indifference and vitriolic hate Sên Ya Tin was
almost devoid of creature feeling. She was critical and
self-indulgent to a degree. She was brutally, and sometimes
coarsely, frank. But she had high principles,
and she never relaxed in her personal adherence to
them—no matter what the cost to her own inclination
and convenience. It was largely from this grandmother
that Sên King-lo had inherited the uprightness of
character and relentless habit of self-analysis that underlay
and dominated all his suavity and sunny good nature.
He had inherited also from her no little of his manliness,
but he had inherited from Ya Tin few of his
tastes. Indeed, she had few, and, unlike most women
of her years and power, she had no foibles. Her sometimes
wearing yellow was not a foible, it was an assertion.
China until recently was an empire of innumerable
kingdoms—and queendoms—and in her own Sên Ya
Tin would brook little control, and still less dictation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a Chinese woman she was very untalkative. Nothing
escaped her narrow, bead-like eyes; little came free
to her tongue. But she always spoke the truth—almost
un-Chinese in this, and, too, it must be owned, a little
unfeminine. She was capable of almost incredible indifference,
but also, though far more rarely, of exquisite
sympathy. She was almost devoid of a sense of humor—almost
denying her Chinese blood in that. Few had
heard her laugh, and no one, but three men who were
dead, ever had seen her smile. She cared for few
amusements—unless her pipe was one—and she was
not industrious. She was intellectual, but read few
books—cared little to whet her mind on the minds of
others. Argument vexed her. Conference and conversation
bored her. The music that King-lo so loved was
nothing to her, and the poetry that fed him as the river
feeds the verdure and cereals on its banks never nourished
and rarely pleased her. She took flowers for
granted, but she liked and understood fine stuffs. Ivories
interested her, and lacquers enchanted. She liked all
animals, and they liked her. She regarded children as
belongings and possibilities. She was ruthless to servants.
She ate but little and paid little heed to what
she ate, or when. She was without religion, except for
her personal creed and observance of uprightness and
her belief in China and her loyalty to it. Her nepotism
was broad but easy-going, more her one milk of human
kindness than a cult. She loved the stars and gloried
in them and was no mean astronomer. She had few
superstitions and no cheap ones. She was not prejudiced.
She had a fine and very mathematical mind,
though she cared more for color than for form. She
had little imagination but great intuition. She was
neither a man’s woman nor a woman’s woman. She
thought most women dolls or harpies and most men
gullible and weak. She liked or disliked, if she did
either, at first sight, and she never changed her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the scant half-hour of their initial visit, Sên
Ya Tin repelled Ruby, who thought her ugly, sour, and
mediocre. But Sên King-lo saw that Ya Tin liked, and
in some odd, strong way approved of, his English wife,
and his heart leapt and his courage quickened that
she did. He had not expected it, and it seemed to
brace and stamp the self-respect of what he had done
and the un-Chinese choice he had made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wondered why his grandmother did. She could
have told him. She, too, had caught a something Chinese
in this alien granddaughter-in-law. She liked Ruby’s
uncringing manner—to which she was unused in the
women her sons and her sons’ sons had married. And
she thought the younger woman rather brave than foolish
to have made both the marriage and the journey she
had. There was nothing that Sên Ya Tin admired more
than she did courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên Ya Tin questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sên answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over and over again—that and only that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the small bowls of green, smoking tea and the
scant sweetmeats came and were given and taken without
a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Sên Ya Tin dismissed them.</p>

<h1 id='t11330'>CHAPTER XLVII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>It rained all the next day, and King-lo sat with his
wife and read to her and talked with her of England
and of Ruben. And they wrote letters home—letters
that would be long in going; for runners must take
them to a distant, but the nearest, treaty-port, before
they could make any positive postal start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards evening Sên Ya Tin sent for her grandson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby scarcely expected to see her husband for hours;
but almost at once, as she sat crocheting, he came back,
eager of pace and of face—and a soberly dressed man
followed him to her side and bowed, crossed his hands,
and stolidly waited, not looking at Mrs. Sên but carefully
eyeing the silk jumper she was making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deft-fingered always, Ruby practically had discarded
needlework—even its pretty playtime offshoots—since
her marriage, no longer in need of her own industry
to be always well-dressed. She had liked to sew well
enough, partly, no doubt, because she did it so well;
but she had hated the necessity, and she always had
taken more pleasure in shopping than in making or
mending.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in Hongkong King-lo had warned her, “You
may be dull some days—just at first—at the homestead,
while it is all strange. Take along something to do,
something you like doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sên had laughed it to scorn, the suggestion that
she could be dull, even for an hour, alone with him in
China, with him in the wonderful place he’d called home
as a boy. But he had repeated his words, even appealing
to her, and to please him she had laid in a great store
of ivory needles and silks. And already she was finding
the advice she had laughed at good, for already she had
found the life in the women’s quarters monotonous and
deadly. She could quite understand why the painted
and jewel-hung prisoners smoked so incessantly. She
herself was smoking more cigarettes in a day here than
she ever had smoked in London or Washington in a
fortnight. One must do something, drug the discomfort
of personal stagnation with some sedative motion,
if only of one’s hands. One couldn’t smoke all the time—at
least, she could not, so she had begun an elaborate
jumper that she didn’t need and could not wear in
Ho-nan over a stiffly embroidered Chinese coatee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at King-lo with questioning eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s one of the tailors,” Lo told her. “Sên Ya Tin’s
best one. She has sent him to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To me! What ever for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To make you a habit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A habit—what sort of habit?” Did she need more
Chinese clothes, she thought rebelliously. Did they think
she was going to stay here forever? Lo had promised
to take her home. Didn’t they know that? Ruben was
in England! Didn’t they care?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A riding-habit,” King-lo told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Chinese riding-habit! I didn’t suppose there
were any. Why must I wear it? When must I wear it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Sên said gently, “there are no Chinese riding-habits.
An English riding-habit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He couldn’t make one,” Mrs. Sên retorted with an
unappreciative glance at the motionless tailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can make most things,” Sên laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he ever seen an English habit?” his wife demanded.
She was not in the least convinced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely not,” King-lo owned, “nor any other sort
of riding-habit, nor even any sort of a picture of one,
I dare swear. But he’s a genius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t look it,” Mrs. Sên remarked crisply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Granted,” her husband agreed good-naturedly, “but
you know the classic adage, ‘Things are not always
what they seem’—not even Chinese things. ‘Skim
milk’—you know the poem. This chap can do as he’s
told.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who’s to tell him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby giggled—she had not often done that of late.
“You’re crazy, Lo,” she asserted. “I couldn’t tell
him how to make one, and I’m sure you can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too sure,” King-lo advised her. “Ah, here
come the stuffs for you to choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several half-grown Chinese boys had padded in as
he spoke, each carrying a paper-wrapped roll of material—sober-eyed
lads with far shaven foreheads and
silk-tasseled queues hanging almost to the hems of their
sober robes, the crest-badge of the Sêns on each blue-clad
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master-artist Worth’s apprentices,” Sên pronounced
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell them to apprentice off then,” his wife commanded.
“They look more like dummies than apprentices,”
she added. “Tell them to go, Lo. I don’t
want a habit—here—what should I do with it? We
couldn’t even ride in Hongkong. Send them away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute,” Sên King-lo begged. “The grandmother
will be disappointed. She has planned it to
give you pleasure. Two of the grooms are trying out
a horse for you now, a splendid, gentle creature that
my cousin Wang’s son often rides. The venerable one
has commandeered it for you. It has never had a woman
on its back, or a side-saddle, but it has a side-saddle
now: the saddlers were up all last night, making it by
candle-light. Sên Wo P’ing has seen Englishwomen
ride in Shanghai on the Bubbling Well road, and he
was with them all night—it was the grandmother’s
command—directing them as they worked by candle
and torch and lantern light. And they’ll be doing it
again tonight. Ka’-ka’ is careering about now in the
storm with a side-saddle on her back, but it is only a
half-finished one. One groom is clutching and dancing
at her bit, hanging there for grim life, the other is
side-saddled on her back and looks like to break his
neck—but he won’t do it. They all three are having
the time of their lives, as we used to say in Washington.
But tomorrow or the next day Ka’-ka’ ’ll be as tame as
any rabbit. The old heart is set on it, and so is mine.
Won’t you have her kindness, wifeling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby Sên rose slowly, the silken jumper falling to
the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is very, very kind, your grandmother,” she
said softly, and King-lo saw a mist in her eyes. “I
shall love to ride here with you. Come, help me choose,”
she bade him as she moved towards the stolid waiting
urchins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo’s face glowed. He was grateful to Sên
Ya Tin, and he was grateful to Sên Ruby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, seeing them engrossed with soft cashmeres and
stout tussores, the master tailor dropped on a surreptitious
knee, then squatted squarely on the floor with his
feet tucked in beneath him, and studied the fallen
jumper eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, dear?” Sên asked her presently, when
he saw a new perplexity a little wrinkling her forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t my riding-skirt drive the mare crazy, Lo?
You say she has never carried a lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor has she, but,” Sên chuckled, “you forget—Ka’-ka’
has carried many skirts—quite as long ones
as the one you wear in the Row.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife turned a sudden painful crimson. She <span class='it'>had</span>
forgotten for a moment. Was she to ride with her
husband riding beside her wearing petticoats?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lo saw and understood. But he gave no sign and
moved quietly to his wife’s writing-table, sat down and
found a brush and dipped it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?” Mrs. Sên asked as she
followed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make your riding-habit,” King-lo told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lo, you are wonderful!” she exclaimed, as the habit
grew quickly on the pad, a habit perfect in every detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had found a new talent in her Chinese man, and
she leaned and watched him proudly with her hand
upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tailor slipped up without a sound and came and
watched the rapid brush-work too. And when it was
finished, he drew a long tape from his sleeve and nodded
without speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says, ‘Can do,’ ” Sên told her, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was true, whether the man had said it or
not. The new habit completed would have disgraced
neither Rotten Row nor Bond Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên Ya Tin stood and watched them as they started
for their first ride together in China, an odd, but not
unkind, look in her sharp, agate-hard eyes. She smiled
a little, grimly—she who had not smiled since this
Sên’s father had died—smiled when King-lo held his
hand under Ruby’s boot and mounted her so. And
Ya Tin stood and watched them till they were out of
sight, lost in the verdure of the far-off hillside; for the
day was very clear, and Sên Ya Tin’s ageing eyes were
very sharp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Lo had come to tell her that the horses were
ready at the house door, Ruby had started a little and
then had flushed; for King-lo’s riding clothes were as
British as her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How would Madame Sên like this, Ruby wondered—if
Madame chanced to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, if Sên Ya Tin was surprised, she scorned to show
it, and Ruby wondered if she’d already known and consented,
for she knew that no innovation intruded into
the queendom of Sên Ya Tin that did not come licensed
by imperious Ya Tin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first of many rides, and they were the best
and the most wholesome pleasures of Ruby Sên’s sojourn
in the homestead of the father of her child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they galloped side by side through the quivering
bamboos on the hillslopes, along the mossy banks
of a rushing river, through avenues of vermilion roses,
under fragrant, wax-flowered lemon-trees that met and
roofed above them, some of the old springtime ecstasy
and comradeship came back to her, and the charm of
her man found and wrapped her again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her escort was as devoted and as careful of her as
he’d been on the Potomac, his eyes as kind, his laugh as
ready. But it was his breeding, the breeding of his race,
the man’s loyalty to the woman who had trusted him
and given her life into his keeping, the personal loyalty
of his manhood and his being that laughed and chatted
with her as they rode; for Sên King-lo was not <span class='it'>with</span> the
English wife who rode beside him, Sên King-lo was back
in China, his soul meshed in China’s, his heart torn, every
nerve an ache, with the thought that again he must go,
go from the flowers and skies of China, from her rainbowed
loveliness and her barren rocky places and her
wild and rushing torrents, from the customs of his
people, the tombs of his ancestors, and the dingy, disregarded
temples of their gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he drew his bridle, and slacked their pace,
and pointed with his slender amber whip to some special
bit or stretch of beauty, and called her attention to it
in a quiet voice that almost trembled and that throbbed
in his throat, Ruby scarcely <span class='it'>saw</span>, caught no message;
because this was China, and China would forever leave
her cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is human blood and story that makes country, not
architecture or flora, neither bleating polar cold nor
seething equatorial heat.</p>

<h1 id='t11603'>CHAPTER XLVIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou wilt cleave to her then, my son?” Ya Tin
asked gravely, as they sat alone at midnight
conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While I live,” Sên King-lo answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet it tortures thee to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It tortures me,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you wish to go?” Ya Tin asked calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon,” King-lo pleaded. “Dismiss me soon, O
Mother, I entreat thee. The lingering is hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I will <span class='it'>not</span> dismiss thee—will not dismiss thee
ever, Sên King-lo, or release thee from the obedience
and fealty thy ancestors have sworn of thee? But chain
thee to my side, and to thy place of heritage where thou
belongest, where thy spirit will be, no matter where
or how thy bones will go? What then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo held her eyes with his, but he made no
other answer, neither spoke nor moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat so while the water-clock dripped slowly
in their silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the Chinese grandam laughed, leaning a little
towards him, mocking him with her eyes; a grim, gray
crackle of laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou wilt disobey me, if I forbid thee go! And I
am Sên Ya Tin, and thou art Sên King-lo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still he neither spoke nor moved. But his soul gave
her soul answer, and her stern soul met his and hailed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still a time she let the water-clock drip and the silence
keep between them as they sat with nothing else between
them but the tiny, low table of her pipes’ lacquered
tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough!” she spoke at last. “Go! And go in
peace, Sên King-lo, first-born of my first-born. I have
other sons of our race. But thou shalt go richer than
thou camest. Much of thy heritage shall go with thee.
Nay!”—as his lips moved to frame a word, his hand
gestured towards protest—“it is my will. I will not
brook it otherwise; for thou art the son of the dearest
thing I ever suckled or quietened in my arms, and it is
punishment enough for thee that thou must go, must go
from China.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên’s face quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” she added quickly, “thou art right to go,
King-lo, and I would not have it otherwise. I am
shamed that thou must lie in the barbarian land, shamed
that thou mayst not dwell <span class='it'>here</span>, as thou shouldst, with
thy Chinese wives about thee and thy small-footed concubines
and thy scores of slave-girls. My honorable
lord had many—more than he could count, or cared to—but
I counted them all, and I ruled them well. All
the province knew what a Number-one I was, and they
heard it and spoke of it in the Vermilion Palace at
Pekin. My lord, thy father’s father, boy, took no heed:
he cared more for the stickpins in my hair than for
all the painted roses on his under-women’s faces; but
I took great heed of all his women and their children
and of all that was his. And I burn in flame that no
such state as he kept thou shalt keep—in thy celestial
native land. But thou art right. I applaud. Did I
forbid, thou wouldst disobey,”—again the crackled
chuckle—“and it pridens me that thou wouldst. A Sên
must pay his score at the inn of life. Thou hast made
a marriage-bargain with a foreign woman and made
it in her own barbarian way. It was thy weakness and
thy sin. But now the tally-hour has come, and thou
must pay. The man who cheats a woman, or mocks her
with a payment in coin she does not value, is lower
than the vermin that feeds on putrid shellfish, fattens
on the slime-bellied scavengers of the ocean. Go—when
thou wilt. And I will raise a <span class='it'>pai-fang</span> for thy
pardon of our gods; I will build a great temple on the
hill where the peach trees cram the melons on its slope
and the cypresses wear the winter snow on its crest; and
I will make the old temple, where thou madest thy young
play as a child, a riot of blooming flowers, a hymn of
running water. The nightingale and the kingfisher shall
join in its song, and I will cram the temple hall with
jades and yellow roses. That shall be thy penance here in
China, as loneliness and longing shall be thy penance in
England—the England of thy wife; and perchance the
gods will accept my bounty and thy pain, and thou
shalt come again to thy people in the garden of on high.
We will not often send message or courier to each other,
I and thou, for it is ill to scald a sore; but thou shalt
think of me, and I shall think of thee, across the oceans
and the years. I shall hold my pride in thee for the
sacrifice thou makest and the troth thou keepest even
to the end; for it proves thee worthy of the milk I
gave thy father, O, babe of my babe. Greatness is built
on sacrifice, always it is so. I bless thee, and I bless
thy sacrifice, Sên King-lo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose, unsteadily, and then k’o-towed before her
slowly; once, again, and then again. Then he slipped
to her feet and laid his hand upon her girdle and his face
against her knees. And Sên Ya Tin laid her palms on
his hair and smoothed it softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last she sent him to his rest, for the day was breaking,
and as he moved to go, she held his sleeve a moment,
and said, “I like thy woman, the girl with thy mother’s
milk-name. She is a woman of the barbarians, but she
is a sash-wearer, Sên King-lo; I like thy English woman.
And she too shall have a taper and a crimson slip of silk-paper
prayer in the temple I will build, and another in the
hall of the old temple over yonder beyond the oak-trees
where thou used to make thy playing in the courtyard.
And her name shall not be taboo or coarsely spoken in
the harem-courtyards of thy kindred. For she has worn
a girdle of thorns under her inner garments here, Sên
King-lo, and she has borne it quietly and bravely like
the sash-wearer that she is. She has neither scratched
nor whimpered. If she bears thee a girl-child, I charge
thee then to send me word, for it shall have my stomacher
of diamonds and my gold-lacquered tobacco-box with the
lizard of rubies on its lid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he left her, and she sat alone while the old
water-clock dripped the morning hours away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Sên King-lo lay a little on his mat, in the room
that he’d used so as a boy—lay down on his mat because
Sên Ya Tin had commanded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon he rose, and when he had bathed and perfumed his
hands, he lit a taper before the ancestral tablet in the
<span class='it'>ko’tang</span> and went out through the courtyard and the
twisting yellow paths, till he stood alone beneath the
cypress-trees on the eastern hill.</p>

<h1 id='t11753'>CHAPTER XLIX</h1>

<p class='pindent'>June flowers grew in the grass, a beryl and cinnabar
sky crowned and mantled the world. The trees were
heavy and big with leaf, grave and gay with a score of
greens. Bees hummed in the wild roses; an old apple-tree,
late but lusty of blossom, buffeted and bent by a
thousand gales—but its good roots held—lay prone on
the ground, its flowers lay a perfumed white and rose
veil heaped on ferns and blue harebells; a baby squirrel
sat bolt up on the prostrate gnarled trunk, industriously
washing his baby face. The summer air had a score of
scents and bore on its fragrant warmth one message.
And married birds were teaching their babies to fly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flowers that had bloomed in the wood at the
Potomac’s edge were blooming here. The same butterflies
swam above them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were wonderful old apple-trees—the prone one
here and the prone one there. But when the apples of
this one ripened they’d be insipid and tasteless, as almost
all Chinese apples are, more ornamental than eatable,
but deliciously scented and valued for that; and the
fruit of the other tree had ripened at Ivy’s wedding-day
as crisp of flesh and full of sour-sweet wine as the apples
that grow in Albemarle County.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby sat on the ground, as she had been sitting for
almost an hour. She crouched there in misery, so motionless
and still that the little squirrel had not scampered
away when he’d come, and scarcely was eyeing her now,
as he completed his toilet and preened and plumed his
feathered, furry tail. He would have whisked off
squirrel-quickest at the farthest sight of a dog; but he
had been born fearless of human creatures, as fearless
as he was of the patient, friendly buffaloes on whose
humped backs he often rode, for Chinese are never cruel
to such soft, small, woodland things, and never kill them
but at need. Rats, and even puppy dogs, if of valueless
breeds, have quick despatch in China often; but wild
little things of softer, longer fur and swifter speed are
rarely molested and never teased, and so are scarcely
wild at all. But this wee squirrelling would have kept
his greater distance and washed his face in greater
seclusion had the woman there on the grass been less
stock-still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brooding eyes were fixed and hard, staring bitterly
at the lovely, laughing landscape before her. It was
prison bars to her, all of it, and the site of her shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it had come to that: Ivy Sên was ashamed, not of
King-lo, never that! but ashamed of her own displacement
and not unashamed now of the birth of her child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was sickening for the sight of Ruben, the song
of his inarticulate baby voice, the feel of his fat, naked,
pink and white foot in her gloating hand, the precious
down of his head against her cheek, the intimacy of his
fearless eyes, the baby claim of his imperious little hand
on her bosom. It had been stingingly hard to leave him,
cruelly so too, because the day of her leaving him had
been also the day of his weaning; but the wrench of that
parting had been less than the dull ache of her waxing
missing of him. She wanted her baby, and every hour
she wanted him more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If King-lo did not take her back to Ruben soon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six months ago!</p>

<p class='pindent'>How had she stood it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much longer could she stand it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been so proudly glad when she first had
known that a babe was soon to lie in her arms, so exultant
when it had come!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now her inmost being shivered and cringed, because
she knew that again a new-born child would lie in
her arms. But not here! Not here in this horrible
China! That should not be. It had come to her in
China, this poor little unborn one, but she would not
bear it in China: they must go home, she and it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not told Lo. She could not tell him here. He
must not know! No one must know or think of it here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why had she come? Had her cousin Charles no love
of her left that he had not warned her of what life would
be to her here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all her torture—and it had been just that—at
leaving baby Ruben behind her, she had come with
radiant gladness—impatiently eager to reach the country
of her husband and to make it hers, without losing for
an instant her own. Lo had done so much, perfect citizen
of the world that he was! Why should his wife be less
splendidly adaptable—more crassly insular? She had
fretted, almost fumed, for the ship to go faster, reach
China sooner, feeling it a laggard, and feeling,</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“—so tedious is this day,</p>
<p class='line0'>As is the night before some festival</p>
<p class='line0'>To an impatient child that hath new robes,</p>
<p class='line0'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And may not wear them.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And yet she could have danced for joy and anticipation
every waking hour of the way on the boats that had
brought them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the impulse of all love is to create, its even greater,
more constant, longer, finer impulse is to share. She had
loved Sên King-lo well, and she had staked her soul to
give him all that was she or hers, to have for her very
own all that was he or his. <span class='it'>That</span> was why she had
insisted upon leaving her child and crossing the world
with her husband, crossing the world into China. She
would give and she would take <span class='it'>all</span>. And he should set
the key and choose and make the frame of their mutual
being: marriage meant that, as her soul and the feminine
instinct of her womanhood sensed and gaged it—and
craved it. His people should be her people, his God her
God. It had not been lust for adventure, or wilfulness,
or freak. It had been loyalty, womanliness, and wifehood.
A splendid, sacred trinity!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they had failed her; she had failed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whose was the fault?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not Sên King-lo’s. <span class='it'>He</span> had not failed her. Her
English fairness, her heritage of centuries, knew it and
said it. Never had man failed woman less, or mate mate.
He never had failed her once, not for a breath, not by
the width of a hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor had her heart failed him. She did not love him
less than she had. His quality appealed to her not less
but more as they passed hand in hand through the long
glade of days. Her husband’s quality was her highest
and firmest pride. He never had grated on her once
nor affronted her taste, and she knew how rarely even
the happiest wives could say that. His charm, that
perfume and weapon of personality that cannot be defined
or expressed, held her almost increasingly; it
gripped her securely and close. And she knew that, be
the years however long, let them bring whatever they
might, stretch wherever they might, she should love her
man to the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew how generous he had been to her—how he
had warded off from her every ill thing, great or petty,
that he could. He had been tender of her every failure,
her miserable little shames, her worthless shrinkings and
had covered and condoned them—had covered them
gently as a hen its chicks under its wing. And what it
must have cost him to see her shrink and “turn”!
Would a Chinese woman have failed an English husband
as she had failed her Chinese husband? She believed
not. Was China’s then the better part? China that she
disliked and was ashamed of! She had made no sacrifice
in marrying Sên King-lo, but she knew now that he had
made a sacrifice in taking her to wife, and could but
have known that he did. For he had known both his
country and hers, his people and hers, had known both
well, and she had known only her own. He had known
all the spiritual barrier, the fundamental prohibition.
He must have realized her disqualifications! And when
pay-day had come, how gaily he had paid the price, how
ungrudgingly! Paid for both. For she knew that his
tally had been tenfold hers. If it had vexed her to be
here, to suffer the repugnance of odd and uncongenial
ways, what must it not have been to him?—and <span class='it'>she</span>—his
<span class='it'>wife</span>—knew that the texture and nerves of his soul
were as fine and sensitive as those of his strong sensitive
hands. (She had seen him balance by its stem a long
peacock feather on the tip of his finger until it ceased
to seesaw or move at all, and she had seen him lift
Reginald Hamilton, bulky and heavily clothed, up off
his saddle and swing him lightly down to the ground.)
What must it not have been to Sên King-lo to see her
scarce-smothered dislike of his home and kindred, of all
that meant <span class='it'>all</span> to him; what must it not have cost him to
bring her here, knowing, as he must have known, how
poor a thing, unfitted and unpolished, she would seem to
Sên Ya Tin, to all his kinsmen, to the women of the
domain, to the very coolies?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had meant so well and so bravely, and she had
done so ill and so cowardly!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been happy in Hongkong. And Hongkong’s
scorn and innuendo had reached her. (In that one
thing she had been cleverer than he.) And she had not
cared. She had been unaffectedly indifferent to it all,
because Sên King-lo was “MacGregor,” and she sat on
his right hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here, where it had mattered most, here where she
had garnered up her dream of infinite and exquisite
sharing with him, here where he had been at her woman’s
mercy, his English wife’s mercy, her happiness had
sickened, her comradeship and pluck had crumpled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little furry thing had finished his toilet, and he
scampered away. The woman never moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh—to see Ruben! Oh—to be in England! Her husband’s
people were not <span class='it'>her</span> people, his home was <span class='it'>not</span> her
home!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruben’s baby voice called her. England called her.
The shabbiest, grimiest taxi in the Strand was more to
her than all the pagodas and lacquers and peonies in
China!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hated peonies now. She always should. She hated
all of <span class='it'>this</span>. The bamboos that bent over there in the
breeze mocked her. She had been pilloried here in
Ho-nan. To live and be with thickly painted, chattering
women who tittered all the time; who never had the
dignity of a sorrow, or the blessing of a care; who had
no responsibility—hadn’t even the grit or tang of jealousy—but
tottered about, because their feet were deformed;
who were vain of their hideous deformity; and
who gorged on sickly sweetmeats and scandal! She
couldn’t understand a word they spoke or whispered,
but she knew Mayfair and Washington too well and too
shrewdly not to know the sound of scandal when she
heard it! To eat with a posse of giggling chattering
women, young and old, or to eat alone, half her meals,
while a dancing bear reared above her shoulder and
growled for tit-bits! To see cats chained and tethered
like house-dogs and hear them wailing how they liked
it! Sên Ya Tin was addicted to cats, and on one moonlight
night the screech and yowl of twenty tethered and
outraged cats had well-nigh crazed Ruby Sên. Lo had
not been there to slake her nervous fury, for he had
been in an all-night attendance on Sên Ya Tin in the
<span class='it'>ko’-tang</span> or hawking in the moonlight with his kinsmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>China! Oh—to go! Oh—never to have come! She
<span class='it'>would</span> escape the place. They could not keep her—they
should not! But could she ever escape the memory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would she love her child—her second baby? She did
not love it now. Could she ever love it—would she when
she heard its cry—a child begotten in this China! She
loved Ruben, second to his father; she loved Ruben, her
fair-haired, Saxon-seeming baby son. She was dearly
proud of Ruben. A young queen-mother might envy her
Ruben. But this unborn child of hers—would she live
to hate the flesh and blood that were bud of her own?
Might she live to be ashamed of her own baby? What
if China marked it!</p>

<h1 id='t12018'>CHAPTER L</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Old women’s ignorant, unscientific tales, silly peasant
chatter—English tales, English chatter—ribaldry
lurched threateningly to her recollection. Laughed
at, turned from in disgust, when she had heard them,
they half distracted her now—and she had been near
enough distraction without their sudden menace. What
if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trembling violently, she crouched still lower on the
ground and hid her face on the old tree’s trunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>King-lo, coming to find her, heard her wild sobbing
long before he saw her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He quickened his pace; but he came very quietly, and
when he reached her he knelt down and laid his hand
upon her shoulder and left it there without a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he waited for the rougher paroxysm of her
grieving to wear itself a little out, he saw that it was
an old apple-tree that lay upon the ground, an apple-tree
struck down by some raging storm of China, in one of those
fury times when the Yellow Sorrow lashed and churned
its low banks into wide, endless miles of hideous flooded
wreckage and of seaweed thick with stark and twisted
floating human bodies, and when angry winds mowed
peasant homes and huts of mat and reeds as sickles mow
the ripened grass; but that, so stricken, the tree still
lived and grew and bore, its good roots still holding
securely in the earth. His face, already tender for his
stricken woman, took an added softness and an added
strength. So, he thought, a man knocked to the ground
might hold with steadfast fibers to the foundations and
nourishment of being, still grow and give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew the old tree well. He had climbed it and
rifled it of its tasteless, rosy, scented apples often when a
boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw the veil of white and pink its blossoms scarfed
upon the grass. He saw the little wild flowers blowing
near it—the June wild flowers of Virginia, and he remembered.
He saw love’s confession and its shyness
come in a girl’s dark English eyes. He held her surrender
and her dearness in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that he would remember this old apple-tree,
its courage and its beauty, this <span class='it'>one</span>, selfsame apple-tree,
in China and Virginia, with its rosy, hopeful, perfumed
signal on the ground, its sturdy triumph of endurance
and persistence in prostration, its dual message and its
dual memory, the little wild flowers smiling at the ferns
beside it; he saw in it a token and a commandment, and
he knew that it would live with him while he lived and
that living it would link—in his spirit—East and West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid his hand upon his wife’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby stirred to the touch and let him lift her to his
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my head,” she told him, choking back her sobs.
“It has ached all day”—as indeed it had. “I wish you
hadn’t found me while I was so foolish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very glad I did,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pain made me cry,” she whispered brokenly. “I
won’t cry any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo had never seen her cry before. But he
only said quietly, as he soothed her hair, “Cry it out,
dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was made a little of his own metal, and she
laughed through her dwindling sobbing and dried her
face upon his sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held her close, and she seemed glad to nest so. And
they stayed together in the quiet, while a squirrel
bounced softly back and looked them up and down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be better soon now,” Ruby said presently.
“It is better already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must try to cure it soon, Ivy.” He had never
called her that before. “Rest a little longer, sweetheart,
then let me take you back and bathe it while you try to
sleep. I cannot take a sick girl the long trail that is
waiting for us, and I had hoped that we might start
tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Start—” She dared not say the rest, but he felt
the pulse leap in her wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—for home, dear,” he finished for her. “It is time
we went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made no answer. She could not trust her voice,
and she was trying desperately to keep some of the joy
from her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you not rested a little?” Lo asked her before
long. “Shall we go, slowly, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite rested—and very much ashamed,” Ruby told
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên lifted her and led her beside him, with his arm
about her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they saw the red roofs in the distance, the red
up-curling roofs of his birthplace, Ruby drew away from
him and faced him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lo,” she asked, “are you sure that you are ready?
Is there any hurry? Lo—tell me—do you want to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want to go!” Sên mocked her, laughing down at
her, and his eyes laughed with his lips, “want to go
<span class='it'>home</span>—and to Ruben!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his wife believed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first lie Sên King-lo had ever told her.</p>

<h1 id='t12150'>CHAPTER LI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>If they had given her courteous welcome, they gave her
kindliest parting. They gave her many words, and
she understood the kindness of their tones. And they
gave her many gifts. Sên Ya Tin gave her jewels and a
jeweled lute, a silver box of sweetmeats, her own face,
painted before King-lo had been born, and a cape of
peacocks’ feathers. The women gave her silks and
embroidered crêpes and opal-tinseled gauze. Her husband’s
kinsmen gave her ivories and jades, and the
toddlers gave her flowers and splint-baskets of persimmons
and lychees, and one gave her its favorite doll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên Ya Tin gave them pleasant, tranquil speeding—at
the outer door this time—and there was no hardness in
her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Sên King-lo went as he had come, with his hand
on his wife’s litter, smiling lips and cheerful, happy
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red roofs of the homestead were dimming in the
distance when a veiled and shrouded woman slipped from
among the trees, and held out a tiny yellow hand to stay
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a gesture from lord Sên King-lo the bearers waited,
and La-yuên came closer, throwing off her dark merino
veiling as she did so. She held out to Mrs. Sên a long
and slender parcel and another that was cube-shaped
and not large, each swathed in rice paper that glistened
silky in the daylight and each tied criss-cross and
securely by thin, red cord-string.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby took what La-yuên offered; but before she could
frame words of thanks, or King-lo improvise them for
her, the girl had shaken her clasped hands at Sên Ruby,
made the k’o-tow of subservience to the lord Sên King-lo,
and darted like a tottering lap-wing back towards the
homestead through the shelter of the forest. But they
both had seen that as she turned and sped away her eyes
had filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the concubine had loved Sên Ruby and was loath
to have her go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ought she to have come?” his wife asked anxiously.
“Will she get in trouble for having left the courtyard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly,” Sên smiled as he said it, “if a eunuch
sees her, or her baby cries before she gets back, and they
hear and miss her. She’ll get a furious wigging—but not
much more for this ‘first offense.’ She’ll not be beaten,
have her stickpins taken away until the new moon, or
get less soy with her evening rice, perhaps. She’ll not
be lowered to the grade of the handmaidens. Po-Fang is
very fond of La-yuên, and so is his Number-one. But I
dare say she’ll worm back in as snugly as she wormed
out. It’s a ‘capital offense,’ but I dare say she knows
her wicked ropes—many of the concubines do—though
I have heard the grandmother say that this girl was the
most obedient of all the flowery quarter. It will be all
right if her baby does not cry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—it is his nap-time now,” Ruby said more contentedly.
“He is not apt to wake, and if he should, he’s
got a stick of barley-sugar in his hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweet dreams!” Lo laughed. “You needn’t fret,
dear. It will be all right, then, if the frog has got his
suck-stick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if a eunuch does see her going back and your
grandmother is told?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will only shrug her shoulders, I think—today—and
send the fellow about some other business; but she’ll
not hear it, I am sure. It would be reported first to
Po-Fang or to his Number-one. She has the right to
hear it first, and she would only laugh and say she herself
had sent the girl on an errand, and Sên Po-Fang would
only wink at the eunuch and toss him a coin. Don’t
you worry,” King-lo repeated as he motioned the bearers
to move on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very wrong of the lord Sên King-lo to be footing
it across China while his woman rode in a padded,
cushioned palanquin. But he had come much of the
way so, he had entered and left the homestead of his
people, on foot, with his hand on his English wife’s chair,
and he was going as he’d come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dusk-fall they halted, and while their servants made
their camp King-lo and Ruby feasted on the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” she said, as she gave him her empty coffee
cup, and nodded to him for a cigarette, “open the
parcels La-yuên gave me. I want to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Sên shook his head, as he struck her match.
“You must not look at your last parting gift, given you
after you had left the protection of the devil-screen. It
will bring you bad luck for eleven moons, if you so much
as peep, until your journey is over, until you are safe
behind your own devil-screen of your own house door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A devil-screen, in Kensington!” she tossed at him
scornfully. “We haven’t got a devil-screen at our front
door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—yes, we have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” Ruby demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love,” her husband told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she answered softly, “and we’ll trust it, outside
as well as in. Cut those strings at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the rice-paper was pulled off it left a striped box
of flat, gaily-colored straw, a box of tiny drawers which,
when Ruby drew them out, showed each a saucer and a
wee soft brush. Sên King-lo chuckled as he leaned over
her shoulder. It was a paint-face outfit—white, carmine,
rose and black, and a number of soft chamois “sop-rags”
and “smooth-off cloths” all complete, that his cousin’s
concubine had given his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a hint,” he chaffed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And here’s a poem!” Ruby exclaimed, pouncing on a
slip of crimson paper lying unfolded on the little piles
of chamois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>La-yuên could neither read nor write—the blind
courtyard scribe must have made the characters of her
message—but she knew that it was sin to deface, or even
crease by folding, a printed, cut, or brushed word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poem! More like a sermon!” Lo laughed as he took
it from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read it to me,” Mrs. Sên commanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Make thy face a garden of roses and lilies and find
favor in thy honorable lord’s eyes,’ ” Lo translated
carefully. “Now you know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy took the crimson letter from him with a quiet
smile and put it back. “Open the other one,” she
ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a fearless woman,” Sên King-lo asserted as
he obeyed. Then he shouted joyfully. La-yuên had sent
his English wife a Chinese “back-scratcher,” but not
such as you can buy any day in State Street in Chicago,
or in Museum and Hart Streets in London: “scratchers”
quite genuine in their not patrician way and useful
enough, if you chance to need them; but sometimes their
tiny hands are imitation ivory, and their long black
handle-stems made of painted wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This tiny palm was of perfect, finest ivory as exquisitely
molded and as perfect as Ruby’s own hand; each
wee knuckle flashed an embedded jewel, very small but
very good; and the sharpness of the minute finger-nails
was considerately smooth. The long handle was of
“green-moonlight” jade: an exquisite, costly toy, despite
the raw suggestion of its useful purpose: an implement
of self-indulgence fit to rasp discomfort even from the
person of a red-button mandarin. And from the “chop”
carved in the jade of the long handle, King-lo made little
doubt that in other days it had done so; but he kept that
surmise to himself.</p>

<h1 id='t12330'>CHAPTER LII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby smiled in her sleep that night, lying in her
tent, dreaming pleasantly and kindly of a Chinese
concubine who had been loath to say “goodbye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dawn King-lo left her still sleeping happily and
went quietly out of their tent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned back on their route and retraced his own
steps of the day before. On a hillock not far from the
tent his wife was in but standing back on their road of
travel, nearer, if only a few rods nearer, to the homestead
he had left—forever—he stood and looked back
towards where the red roofs lay that he could not see—that
he would not see again. His face was very calm,
but its gaiety had gone. No need to wear a mask now!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was his last turning back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that he would not turn back again. This
should be his last self-indulgence, his last lingering alone
with self. He was going into exile—exile self-made, self-inflicted.
He would not falter in his courage, or, while
they lived, fail Sên Ruby, the mother of his son. He
had sown—and he would reap. He would reap a golden
harvest and lay its rich, ripened sheaves at her feet—and
she should never know. She could not be of his people;
to his utmost he would be of hers. His inner soul, his
spiritual core of being, was his own, an ownership no
man could renounce. His soul was his and China’s for
all time; but his heart should beat for the wife he had
chosen and taken, and his daily doings should be as
her country’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dismissed it then—and stood alone with China; a
proud flush dyed his cheeks; tears filled his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo lifted his hands and held them out with a
gesture of farewell and of endless fealty and longing
towards the dominion of the Sêns, the queendom of Ya
Tin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a greeting, and he took one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he turned—again—towards his tents.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>When Mrs. Sên lifted the curtain of her sleeping-tent
and came through it, King-lo was directing the servants
who were spreading the breakfast meal. He was humming
“Annie Laurie,” and he was clad in English
clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why had he done that so soon? she wondered. When
she spoke the question later, Sên replied, “Oh, we may
as well now. The country here is quiet again. I was
needlessly concerned before, I’m sure, and the coolies
know us better now and understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was true. He <span class='it'>had</span> been needlessly doubtful
of his coolies and the servants, whose menace had been
one of social dislike and spiritual disapproval, not of
physical attack. The coolies and servants were good-natured
on all the return journeying. Many of them
lived in Hongkong, and several of them had left their
wives and children in the narrow, crowded streets of
Victoria City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as their morning meal was over, they pushed
on—towards Hongkong and the West. Mrs. Sên would
not delay the restart to change then. But when they
halted again to dine, and for the night (they had not
camped at noon, and lunch had been but a picnic) she
laid aside silk trousers and tinseled satin coat—to her
surprise a little regretfully. They were pretty, if odd,
those costly Chinese garments that Lo had chosen and
given her. They would make wonderful finery for
Albert Hall charity gatherings or for some ducal function
of masquerade, but Sên King-lo’s wife could not
wear Chinese costume for “fancy dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lo was giving her deft aid over a dinner frock that
“did up” in twenty places, most of them beyond her
reach, when she put the troubled question to him in their
tent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s up to you, dear,” he answered with a laugh,
as he snapped a final “popper” behind a puff of <span class='it'>ninon</span>,
for they were dining in some state tonight, al fresco in
the wilderness. “They have served their purpose. You
might make cushions and tea-cosies and those vanity-bag
things you women like to swing out of them, I’d think,
and take them home for presents,” he added. Then he
gave the puff of silvery, smokey <span class='it'>ninon</span> another careful
tweak and bent and kissed a dimpled shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very good to me,” Ruby whispered with
her hands upon his coat. “Lo, tell me, does it hurt you
very much—to leave China?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much,” he told her, “but it would hurt me
more to stay. I have loved being here as only Easterners
love such things, I think; but I am ready to go home
now, Ruby. I take my treasure with me, and we go
back to the treasure we have left. My wife is my happiness
and my contentment. I would not give her for a
world ‘made of one entire and perfect chrysolite’!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>No one called on Mrs. Sên in Hongkong—few knew
that they were back. King-lo scarcely left the bungalow,
the few days they waited for a boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men came to see him, and he completed with them the
business things he had planned and come to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day before they sailed, by the man who took a
message and a greeting to Sên Ya Tin, his wife sent a
letter and an offering to the venerable lady and a horde
of costly Chinese garments to the concubine La-yuên.
Perchance something of China’s quiet, whispered message
had reached Sên Ruby after all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kept one of the lovely native costumes, to treasure
it for memory. She kept all her stickpins and every
Chinese bauble that Sên King-lo had given her, and
with them a flower that he had gathered her in the forest,
and one that he had fastened at her breast, in their bungalow
garden, late the night before. It was then that she
had told him—shared with him—what was coming in the
English winter. And for answer he had put his hands
about her face and kissed her slowly on her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood together on the deck, as the great ship
moved slowly from Hongkong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently his wife made an excuse of something she
wanted in the cabin—no, she’d rather find it herself—and
left Sên King-lo to take his last look, say his last
goodbye to China—alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hongkong grew a blur. Sên King-lo’s face was very
pale as he took his last look at his country; but his eyes
were calm and steadfast, though his heart ached with a
pain passing the pain of woman. And he thought that
the gods of China made mouths at him.</p>

<h1 id='t12484'>CHAPTER LIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>The rural social strongholds in England are far
less complacent and easy-going than London is.
London is something of a jade and unbends to any fun.
The “county” is a prude, respectable to a degree.
“County” never bends. London’s the more human and
undoubtedly has the better time. If “county” has a
finer art of living, London has the prettier knack, and
the gayer, more amusing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the county for my funeral,” Emma told
Sir Charles, “but let me live in London every time.”
But Lady Snow was frivolous and meant to stay so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even Sir Charles, who saw through most things,
could not see why the Sêns had moved to Surrey in
October, almost on their return from China. London
could be trusted to keep its welcome of Mr. and Mrs. Sên
warm, but he doubted considerably whether the semi-county
of Brent-on-Wold would welcome them at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo had his reasons, of course, and probably
they were good ones; but Sir Charles could not think
what they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Sên’s doing, not Ivy’s, Snow was sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby had been quite willing to make the home-move
that her husband had suggested, but not glad. London was
her Mecca and always would be; but she was content
to live wherever Lo wished, if it might be with him and
not in China. She knew that she would not be prisoned
in Surrey, or forbidden long drinks of London’s wine.
King-lo was no wing-clipper, least of all of hers. If he
longed for country life, or chose it for some other reason,
she was more than willing to have it so. It was his turn
to have his way, she felt sincerely. And what did it
matter, if they were together, with Ruben, bonnier than
ever, toddling at their feet, clutching at her skirts? Sên
King-lo had no entire monopoly of loyalty and sunny
niceness, or of fineness and bigness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo had not suggested their moving because
of any longing he felt for flowers and trees, open spaces,
and running water. All such things were one to him
now. London meant a great deal to Sên. And his opportunities
for the big Anglo-Chinese work he still meant to
do, and to do with his might, opportunities for the personal
touch and mutual yeasting of friendly minds and
foemen’s, which are so much of all international work’s
success, were in London tenfold what they could be in
any other spot in Europe. But he knew that he was very
tired, and that unless he rested certain mental and personal
forces of his that had suddenly worn thin, his hand
might lax hopelessly and fall away from its helm. There
was work to do that needed him for its best doing. Ruby
needed him, and would need him more and more as
Ruben grew older. For Sên King-lo already knew what
no one else suspected, not even Charles Snow, that
Ruben’s Saxon body was but the sheath of a mind and
spirit and inclination intensely Chinese. Sên saw a
coming day when it might be for him to stand between
Ruby and their boy; to curb Ruben, to comfort Ruby, to
spare her all he could, to save Ruben from mistakes that
were the heritage of the father’s son. And the child
that was coming in December—how might it not need
him, how might not Ruby need him because of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was because of all this that Sên King-lo had turned
from the vivid rush and inexorable pull of London life
to the haven-quiet of the place he found and bought in
Surrey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winter was mild that year in England. The drooping
weeping-ash trees were naked of their leaves, fires were
comfort as well as “company,” of course; but the grass
still kept a hint of greenness; the holly was scantily
berried; here and there a tiny flower-face peeped up
from the rock garden; an heroic, insensitive, old rose-vine
was erratic enough to put forth a shivered, puny bud; a
japonica-tree at the sunniest stretch of the south wall
frankly threatened to flower. There was no demand at
all for skates, but there was some for racquets by young
and enthusiastic players.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Snows were staying with Sên and Ruby, and the
cook took her orders from Lady Snow, for a time. There
was a trained nurse in the house, and the local doctor
whom Mrs. Sên had chosen “dropped in” at tea-time
fairly often, at Sên King-lo’s request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Today Ruby had not come down to breakfast, Emma
had left the cook to her own devices, and Sir Charles
thought that the doctor was upstairs now and had been
there a deuce of a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles Snow was smoking strenuously, not in the
big drawing-room, but in the pink-and-white absurdity
which the servants called “the downstairs boudoir”—the
big drawing-room’s near neighbor, almost annex—and
that was worse, for the “boudoir’s” dainty, expensive
fripperies were perfect caches for smoke-smell
and smudge. But a man, at least an English man, has a
right to do what he likes when a whole house is at sevens
and sixes, every woman in it looking important, meals
late, fires neglected, and men ignored or snubbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too damned still,” Snow grumbled irritably to
his third cigar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the big man jumped like a nerve-ridden
woman—at least his heart did—at a sudden sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was only a sympathetic tail thumping ingratiatingly
at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello yourself!” Snow replied, glad even of a terrier
to speak to. “<span class='it'>You’ve</span> no business in here. Wait
till my lady wife sees you—only, if you take my advice,
Bimbles, you won’t, old boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bimbles yapped a pleased reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, all right,” Sir Charles retorted; “if you don’t
care, I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even a dog’s company was better than none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened, and Emma hurried in—but before
his wife had closed the door again, Snow had heard a
tiny cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” he demanded anxiously. Emma looked
“bad,” he thought. And that wasn’t her way!</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife made no reply, except to sob and throw herself,
almost vixenishly, in a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” he begged her brusquely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Charlie, it is too terrible,” Emma wailed angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ivy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Snow shook her head. “All of us. It’s a Chinese
baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles Snow looked at her with gloomy eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ugliest baby I ever saw. It isn’t like a baby.
It’s like a hideous little Chinese god, and it looks ten
thousand years old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it mustn’t,” Sir Charles remarked grimly;
“only an emperor may look ten thousand years old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then,” his wife retorted, “it looks twenty thousand.
It hasn’t any eyes—just up-and-down wrinkled
slits. It’s all cheek-bones and <span class='it'>yellow</span>—cheek-bones right
up to its awful little eyebrows. It hasn’t any nose, and
what it has is wider than its mouth, and those horrid up-and-down
slits that I suppose are its eyes, if it <span class='it'>has</span> any
eyes, keep waggle-waggling all the time, blink, blink,
blink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow sighed, a smothered, dreary sigh. Emma’s description
sounded Chinese enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks like Sên, then?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does nothing of the kind!” Lady Snow stormed.
“I tell you it is the most hideous, living thing I ever saw—and
more Chinese-looking than any Chinaman I ever
saw. It looks like Low Tease, or whatever you call him,
when he was nine hundred years old, in those awful
illustrated Chinese books of yours, and it looks twice as
Chinese as Low Tease does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lao Tze was a mere boy of two or three hundred
when he died, dear,” Sir Charles murmured gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care!” Lady Snow snapped through her
angry weeping. “It looks a disgrace! So there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure? Sure that Ivy’s baby looks so <span class='it'>very</span>
Chinese?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure? Of course I’m sure! I’ve seen it, haven’t I?
I tell you, it <span class='it'>is</span> Chinese. Nothing on earth would make
me believe that it was Ivy’s child at all—if I didn’t
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has she seen it—seen it as you have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s seen it, and I suppose she <span class='it'>saw</span> it. She saw a
speck of fluff or something on his coat when King-lo
gave her a drink, and laughed at him for being untidy,
and flicked it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she seem to mind?” Snow asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind? Mind a speck of fluff? Oh, the baby! Mind
the awful Chinese look of it? She didn’t seem to, but
she must. And she’ll hate it! How she’ll hate it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not,” Charles Snow said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she’ll hate it. I hate it now! And King-lo
‘minded’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?” Snow asked quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know—but he did. How can I explain
every single thing to you? You ought to know by yourself.
I’m too upset to go on talking forever. He minded
terribly, I tell you. He went to the window and stood
looking for ages—at nothing. Even his back minded.
He never stirred until Ivy called him back to her. He
minds. I nearly dropped. Don’t <span class='it'>you</span> mind, Charles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not glad,” Sir Charles said gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” his wife conceded bitterly, “that’s something.
Not glad! Wait till you see it, Charles Snow! ‘Finest
race on earth!’ Well, perhaps they are, but—” She
finished the sentence and began another, but the rest of
her words were quite inarticulate through the thick
smother of fresh sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boy or girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commonplace and very usual question seemed to
steady her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the worst of it,” she answered desperately
but clearly. “It’s a girl.”</p>

<h1 id='t12726'>CHAPTER LIV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby Sên did not hate her Chinese baby. And because
she did not King-lo loved her with an added
love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby loved her baby. It was <span class='it'>hers</span>—and Lo’s!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby Sên had a valiant soul, and something of Sên
King-lo’s valor and sweetness had crept into hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sên loved her wee daughter very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo loved his baby girl almost as tenderly
as he loved the mother he had never seen. Once, in the
demanding day of early wifehood when Ruby had asked
him, as wives foolishly will, pathetically must, if his love
of her was his great love, he had told her simply, bravely,
“No Chinese loves any one else as he does his mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all grew to love her—except Emma Snow—she
never did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They named their daughter “Ivy.” Sên King-lo
would have it so. But her signature was written on her
face—a Chinese signature. Lady Snow had been right
in <span class='it'>that</span>. Little Sên Ivy was unmistakably Chinese. Both
Sên himself and Sir Charles Snow knew that they never
had seen a being that looked more typically or more
intensely Chinese. She had not a trace of Europe on
her; but almost from the first Sên King-lo suspected
that she had almost no trait of China in her, that—except
for that outer sheath of Chinese beauty—she was all
a Western.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily for both the babies, Ruben was delighted
with his sister and vastly proud of her—though he
called her, as soon as he could talk, “funny Ivy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in one thing Emma Snow was wrong. Baby Ivy
was very lovely, in her vivid, flower-like Eastern way:
a lovely, laughing, pomegranate child. She was lovely
from the first. New-born babies are not often beautiful,
unless to mother eyes. Most of them have a smudged, unfinished
look, and they come red-raw and wrinkled into
life. But Baby Ivy’s loveliness came with her, and it
grew as she grew. Sir Charles Snow sometimes thought
that, had she lived in China in the old imperial days, her
face might have gained her the yellow chair of an Emperor’s
first wife and the throbbing desire of any
countryman that ever saw her. The Trojan war was
not fought for a woman; but wars have been fought so
in Asia, and Snow smiled grimly, more than once, thinking
that her Surrey birthplace had perhaps spared Asia
bloodshed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after Christmas the Snows left Brent-on-Wold.
Emma was due in Devon where their children had been
holidaying with her mother, and Sir Charles was wanted
at the Foreign Office. M. P.s and Barristers and even
mere peers may take and make themselves long and frequent
holidays, but woe betide us all if the Foreign
Office took a breather! That Whitehall bulwark of
Empire must, like Tennyson’s brook, go on forever—though
not often so tranquilly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stayed for the christening, and then the Sêns
were left alone in their new home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby throve, and Ruby was vigorous and active
again. And Lo promised that she should ride with him
soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both secretly wondered if the local gentry was going
to call, and, except for the other, neither cared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentry was wondering the same thing and was
both more interested and exercised about it than were
Mr. and Mrs. Sên.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several ladies, younger ones, wished to call; several
others, older ones, preferred to avoid the necessity. But
that had nothing to do with it. None of them would dare
to call, or to receive Mrs. Sên, unless Lady Margaret
Saunders did; and, if Lady Margaret did, no other
matron of Brent-on-Wold’s upper-circle would presume
not to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Margaret Saunders ruled Brent-on-Wold and its
adjacent small estates, as completely and autocratically
as Sên Ya Tin ruled in a coign of Ho-nan, and she ruled
far less amiably, far more erratically. Sên Ya Tin was
tyrannical but easy-going. There was nothing easy-going
about Lady Margaret Saunders. She hectored the village
shopkeepers, of whom her patronage was small;
she alternately cajoled and abused the rector and almost
invariably prescribed his texts; she had driven two curates
away and sent one to the milder rule of the county
asylum. She controlled the relieving officer, the cottage
hospital, and the tennis club—although she’d never had
a racquet in her hand. She directed the procedure of
the cricket and football clubs and dictated the number
of the buns and the strength of the tea with which they
regaled visiting teams, though she had neither sons nor
grandsons to bowl or to kick the national balls. She <span class='it'>was</span>
the local flower-show, though the glass at “the big house”
was not much and the grounds were more occupied with
broccoli and potatoes than with roses and carnations.
She had “early closing” changed from Wednesdays to
Thursdays. And not even the cottage women who “went
out to oblige” ever defied her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one defied Lady Margaret Saunders. She was not
pleasing to look at and less pleasing to converse with.
She had a German face, which was a libel on her ancestors,
and an enormous Jewish nose, which was a
crueler libel on the Hebrew people. All her forebears
were Yorkshire. She sniffed in public and nagged in
private. No one liked her. No one disputed or challenged
her acid authority. She ruled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why? Because it was her nature to rule. Dominance
was her being, and her dominance was as direct and relentless
as Niagara. Her force was Titanic, and her bad
manners were irresistible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was not only obeyed, she was courted. And
Lady Margaret was not only courted, but reverenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “gentry” was her creature, disliked her to a
woman, and feared her to a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Brewster was the woman most nearly admitted
to her intimacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Saunders had left a leg in the Kyber, and his
other leg’s foot as well. He spent his days now in a
wheel chair. His wife called him “Polly,” and paid
very little attention to him—in public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were childless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Margaret Saunders called on Mrs. Sên, and then
the “gentry” rushed to do the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentry of Brent-on-Wold was two doctors, the
rector, a scattering of army officers—many of them retired,
others still on the “List,” and serving at Aldershot,
Farnborough, Camberly and the War Office—a
well-to-do musician who could neither play nor compose,
a retired architect (who wished he hadn’t), a novelist
who did write but didn’t seem to publish, and a veritable
millionaire who had wandered in from Leadenhall Street
(and escaped from Bayswater) in a Rolls Royce and a
sable coat, with a chef, a maître d’hôtel and three footmen
in his wake. Then there were a dozen others,
neither rich nor poor, who owned their own homes and
each paid a cook and parlor-maid, did nothing for a living,
and dressed for dinner—with, of course, their
families.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo had not chosen the locality of their new
home for its society. He had chosen it for its roses and
the beauty of its hills and vistas. Nightingales had a
leafy stronghold in the woods and gardens of Brent-on-Wold.
The house suited them rather more than moderately.
It was not too far from London for people
who had as good a car as theirs was. Sên King-lo did
not in any way intend that Ruby should be cut off from
London or from London friends, or that he should even
stay permanently in the countryside, if she should prove
to dislike it. For himself he craved a little rest, or,
rather, he felt that he must have it. It was rest, not rust,
he craved and thought he needed: not to slack his industriousness
but to slake it in a hill-set garden. He liked
“Ashacres”; Ruby liked it when he took her to see it;
and, almost best of all, its purchase and occupation were
immediately available. So he bought it, and they furnished
it and moved in in less than a fortnight from the
day that Ruby first saw it. Money in sufficiency can
speed up most human sloths—even lawyers and furniture
dealers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they did not dismantle their Kensington house, or
even close it, for Ruby should have her old home ready
and waiting whenever she chose to go there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Margaret Saunders had not intended to call on
Mrs. Sên, and Lady Margaret was almost as little given
to changing her mind as Sên Ya Tin was. But she had
a nephew at the Foreign Office whom she loved better
than she liked him, and when she heard that Sir Charles
and Lady Snow were staying at “Ashacres” and that the
influential diplomat was Mrs. Sên’s cousin, she thought
she’d think it over. Then Lady Brewster had the presumption
to assume that Lady Margaret Saunders would
not call on Mrs. Sên, and that settled it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Margaret called at once. She liked young Mrs.
Sên, and she liked Chinese Mr. Sên, a perfect gentleman,
and intelligent, very much indeed, and she said so
steadily for several days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. Sên were as pleasantly established in
Brent-on-Wold as they’d been in London.</p>

<h1 id='t12936'>CHAPTER LV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>It had been an unflawed year of renewal and achievement.
They had ridden a great deal—always gay
and happy and near to each other when they rode together—with
something of the surprise and enjoyment of
their first ride together always recurrent and fresh in
their last. Sên King-lo danced as willingly as ever and
as well. He still made music for his wife whenever she
bade him. Their congeniality held, and he was still her
lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “gentry” had proved far less dull than it had
seemed at first. King-lo found and made many interests
here, and Ruby found several amusements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên King-lo became a sort of lord of the manor, unofficial
but acknowledged and accredited, as respected as
the official one who, through no fault of his own, was very
deaf, a trifle gouty, and more than a trifle parsimonious.
Mr. Sên was the more popular and the more consulted
of the two. Half the children in the village brought their
troubles to him, and so did the postmaster, the rector, the
constables,—there were three there and thereabouts—and
the sidesman; and more than once so did Lady
Margaret Saunders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brent-on-Wold was a happier and a kindlier place,
and a more awake and alive one, because a Chinese man
had come to live there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruby was entirely contented now, and she often
chatted frankly, almost affectionately, of her days in
China. Released from it, Ho-nan grew a very pleasant
and interesting place in her memory and in her talk.
She sometimes spoke of her bungalow on the Peak with
a regret that was perfectly unaffected and sincere. Her
husband was Chinese, and so was their name; but she
did not mind in the least, because Lo was so thoroughly
English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Sên King-lo had trod a ploughshare, he had trod it
to good purpose; and, if he had, no one in England suspected
it, unless Charles Snow did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow caught a hint of terror in the younger man’s
eyes now and then—or thought he did; for he was never
quite sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next to her husband, Ruby Sên loved her children,
and even King-lo did not know that she sometimes wished
that Ivy might, as she grew, grow a little more English
in appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know how ever Ivy will bring herself to
present little Ivy when she’s old enough,” Emma Snow
had said to Sir Charles more than once. “I know I
couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles made no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Debonair always, interested in everything that his wife
cared for, boyishly ready to play tennis with her, to ride
or sing with her, to help her entertain or be entertained,
yet Sên King-lo found time to be alone sometimes and to
spend a great deal of time with his children. Baby Ivy
spent hours on her father’s knee—in some quiet garden
nook when the day was warm enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bond between the two was very close. Ruben’s
chief love was for his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ivy—little Ivy—was a child of many moods, and she
had a vein of quarrelsomeness. The two nurses found
her a handful. Ruben gave no one any trouble ever;
but he was an odd little fellow. He liked to be alone
and would lie for hours on his stomach by the brookside,
watching one flower, or flat on his sturdy back, gazing
raptly at the changing clouds. His color came and
went at the odor of a rose; his eyes would fill at the
singing of a bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruben had a “temperament”; Ivy had a temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it only broke out angrily upon her father once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were sitting in the garden, the baby and the man.
His arms were close about her, and she was playing with
his watch. The day was very still; they were quite alone.
A linnet called to its mate. At the sound King-lo raised
his face to the sycamore tree above him and quoted softly
but aloud a Chinese line that Li Po had made for Kublai
Khan’s daughter twelve hundred years ago. At the
sound of the strange tongue she’d never heard before,
the baby’s Chinese face was convulsed with sudden fury,
and she tore her tiny hand from the bright yellow timepiece
and struck her father in the face with all her angry
might.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>When Sên King-lo was alone now he was very quiet.
Neither book nor work occupied him. He sat almost
motionless, with his eyes on the trees or turned with a
brooding hungry look towards the East. A man might
have sat and seemed so who kept tryst with memories
and with a self that had gone far away. And when he
kept alone so, and the bell in the old village church
chanced to ring, a strange wistful smile flickered slowly
on his face.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was May again. The snowballs were out, and the
golden laburnum and the bluebells, and the early peas
were hinting thinly in their pods. Sên King-lo knew
what no one else suspected. He knew that his exile
was nearly ended—unless indeed the angry gods of China
would debar his very spirit from the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He feared it—but he hoped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His bones would lie forever in the quiet churchyard
here—for he had willed it so—until his ashes lived again
in the petals of the flowers growing on his grave; but he
knew that his soul would take its flight towards the East
even while the English church-bells tolled his body’s
passing to its English grave. But he thought, he dared
to hope and think, that some time, after centuries of
homeless wanderings, perchance, though forever banished
from his kindred “on high,” the gods would give his
spirit—at the Feast-of-Lanterns time, perhaps—leave
to mingle with the spirits of his ancestors and be with
them in Ho-nan, and look upon the living children of
the Sêns as they came from the red-roofed homestead
to the high hillside, to watch the long processions of
the lanterns swaying, wending.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>June had come. Sên King-lo was dying. He was
dying as he had lived. He was dying in the garden,
sitting easy in his cushioned wicker chair, a red rose on
his knee, his eyes smiling into Ruby’s, his hand upon her
hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So quietly had his release come to him that until a
week ago no one had seen or heard it coming—no one
but he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden spasm—here, too, in their garden—one afternoon
had turned Ruby’s happy chatter to a cry of
terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clutching, grinding pain had gone almost as it
came, but she had summoned doctors and wired to her
cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctors spoke of indigestion, and one who was a
grandfather had patted Mrs. Sên upon her shoulder and
told her that it was “quite all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ruby Sên had seen the attack which the doctors
had not, and her alarm did not pass. And King-lo bent
his will and his love to comfort her alarm rather than to
disabuse it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Snow reached them, or the great man from
Harley Street that Ruby had ’phoned for, the local doctors
could make nothing of the case, and the London
physician told Sir Charles frankly that he could make
no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No other attack of pain came; but each day Sên moved
a little more slowly, and his gray pallor deepened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took no farewells. He gave no last directions, made
no last requests. He neither kept his bed nor moped.
He was ready, and all that he could do for those he was
leaving was in readiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept his wife’s hand in his and was her lover to
the last, because he loved her and because he knew that
to have him that to the utmost moment of their comradeship
would be the dearest, proudest memory he could
give her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to Sir Charles, the day after Snow came, Sên
King-lo lifted a corner of his curtain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” Sên said as they sat together for an hour—the
only hour that Ruby left him till he died—“that
you will do all you can for Ruby—always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her kinsman nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is something I am anxious to say to you.
I cannot lay the burden on Ruby, and I cannot lay it
down. I must pass it on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow held out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep Ruben and Ivy in England—always—if you
can. Build up to that. Life will go hard with them.
They must pay the price I owe! But I believe that it
will be a lighter price, and less galling, if they never
know my people or my country. I wish that I might
hope that neither my boy nor girl would marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the strangest wish a Chinese father ever
framed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Charles Snow understood, and again he merely
nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s
teeth are set on edge,’ ” Sên King-lo quoted sadly.
Then he said, “I fear least for Ruben, but I fear—terribly—for
them both. Ruben is Chinese. He looks
English, but he is thoroughly Chinese. If he marries,
he should marry a woman of our people, a Chinese girl
whose parents live here, just possibly. That will be so
more and more, I believe. But I wish earnestly that
he may not marry—or Ivy either. You know why.
Teach Ruben to worship his mother, to garner his heart
upon her, to live for her. It will not be difficult, I am
sure, since his instincts are so intensely Chinese.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow wondered if his cousin herself might not marry
and hated himself for letting the thought come to him
here and now. She was still so young and so full of
life and of beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sên King-lo knew that Ruby would be Sên Ruby
while she lived. He <span class='it'>knew</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is for Ivy,” King-lo went on, “that I fear most.
Mere baby that she is, I know she is English. Yes, I am
right. She is as English as Ruben is Chinese, more so
perhaps. The mixture of race bloods has modified nothing
racial for either of our children—fomented and intensified
rather. Ivy is wholly English. I can see it
every day. Sometimes when I have been alone, not often
but sometimes, I have said something in Chinese—just
to hear the Chinese words, just to taste them on my
lips. I did, not long ago, when I was nursing her. She
didn’t like it. She loathed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That sounded fantastic—but Sir Charles did not think
so. He had lived too long in China!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An English girl with a Chinese face, an English soul
and mind in a Chinese body! What she’ll probably have
to live through! I beseech the gods that she may never
marry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Charles Snow noticed the plural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An English girl in a Chinese body!” Sên’s voice
broke as he said it. And he said no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do my best,” Snow told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was enough.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The specialist came again from London the next day,
and again he spoke alone with Snow after he had seen
Sên King-lo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am completely in the dark,” the great man said
bitterly. “Mr. Sên is dying—I can’t say how soon—but
dying, if I know anything at all about my business. We
doctors have to doubt that now and then, unless we are
complete asses. I know that Mr. Sên is dying, or I
think I do, because I can see that there is no grip on life
left in him; but I have not the remotest idea what is
killing him, and that’s flat. There’s been a touch of
heart trouble—no indigestion about it—but I suppose
those fellows here had to call it something, and no wonder
they barked up the wrong tree. I’ve been puzzled
before—a doctor lives in one big maze of puzzle—but I
never ran up against a puzzle like this before. Never!
There has been a touch of heart trouble, but not enough
to kill any man—scarcely enough to kill a mouse. I’d
give a limb to know what is killing Mr. Sên.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll tell you,” Snow said quietly, “if you will
regard it as professional confidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, of course. But—you know? Out with it,
for Heaven’s sake, man!” But the physician’s eager
voice was more skeptical than eager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Homesickness,” Snow told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, you don’t believe that!” Dr. Foster was
openly contemptuous. But, even so, he was interested.
“Go on,” he commanded. “How do you make that
out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know Sên King-lo well, and I know his race,” Snow
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—well,” the physician said after a pause. “I
wonder—we might have tried it—strange things turn
out true ones sometimes—I wonder—we might have tried
it—sending him back to China—but, I’m afraid it’s too
late now. By Jove, I wish I’d been on the track of this
case six months ago!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Sir Charles Snow told him, “you might not
have tried it. He would not go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut! tut! A sick man must do what he’s told, to
get well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow made no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d give a good deal to have been called in sooner—six
months ago or more,” the physician repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d need to have been called in nearly five years
ago,” Snow retorted, “and then you would have failed.
I was on the case five years ago,” he added bitterly, “and
I failed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed,” Dr. Foster remarked limply. Harley Street
does not over-value or over-esteem lay practitioners.</p>

<h1 id='t13271'>CHAPTER LVI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>They were alone in the garden at sunset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had been sitting here, on the broad garden
bench, hand in hand, since tea, but saying little. King-lo
had left her a few moments ago and had gathered the
rose that she was wearing at her breast, where he had
pinned it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sweetpeas need thinning over there,” Lo said,
pointing. Then he drew his hand across her face.
“Ruby!” His eyes smiled into hers, and then, like a
tired child, he laid his head on her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when she understood—it was some time—before
her tears came—his wife bent and kissed him on the lips.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>When the bell began to toll there was scarcely a window
in the village at which a hand did not draw down a
blind.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>When Sir Charles Snow’s letter reached Ho-nan, Sên
Ya Tin proclaimed a year of mourning. Every lute was
put away. Every woman laid aside her gay rich garments,
her stickpins, and her face paints. All the Sêns—women,
men and children, and all their people—were
clad in hempen sackcloth, and their rice was plainly
cooked and scanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gave Sên King-lo his funeral, the funeral of his
rank, in the homestead of his fathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sên Ya Tin walked behind a costly empty coffin, weeping,
wailing, moaning, tearing her white disheveled hair,
and she staggered as she walked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all his kindred followed her, and all their priests,
servants and peasantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his tomb, when the stone was sealed down above
the empty coffin, they spread a princely feast: chicken,
soy, lychees, melon, curd, and yellow wine in costly tiny
cups—food for the spirit of lord Sên King-lo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Sên Ya Tin fasted till she fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in her heart Sên Ya Tin did not grieve. For she
thought that it was better so.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The berries are red upon the holly. There is snow
upon the graves. It is quiet in the churchyard.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
